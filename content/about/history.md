## History

GRASS (Geographic Resources Analysis Support System) has been under continuous development since 1982 and during the 90s a large number of federal US agencies, universities, and private companies were involved in the development. The core components of GRASS 1.0-5.0 and the management of the integration efforts into GRASS GIS releases were accomplished by the U.S. Army - Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (USA-CERL) in Champaign, Illinois. USA-CERL completed its last release of GRASS as version 4.1 in 1992, and provided five updates and patches to this release through 1995. USA-CERL also wrote the core components of the GRASS 5.0 floating point version. In 1997 and after two years of uncertainty, GRASS development was taken over by academia. Since then the international GRASS Development Team manages the source code, releases and documentation.
