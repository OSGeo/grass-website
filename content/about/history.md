## Our history

### The 80's

GRASS GIS has been under continuous development since 1982, when the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers' Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (USA/CERL)
started exploring the use of Geographic Information Systems for environmental
research, monitoring and management of military lands. Since no other software
package available back then met all their requirements, they designed and 
developed their own. GRASS GIS was born under the name of Fort Hood 
Information System (FHIS). Meanwhile, other US federal agencies and environmental 
offices became interested and the more general purpose GRASS was born. 

Several universities adopted GRASS as an important training and research 
environment and many conducted short-courses for the public, in addition 
to using GRASS in their own curricula. Indeed, in 1988, GRASS received an
award for quality software from the Urban and Regional Information 
Systems Association (URISA) for quality software. Only 4 years after 
the first release.

### The 90's

During the 90's a large number of US federal agencies, universities, and 
private companies were also involved in the development. 
The core components of GRASS versions 1.0 to 5.0 and the coordination of
efforts towards GRASS GIS releases were led by the USA-CERL in Champaign,
Illinois. USA-CERL completed its last release of GRASS as version 4.1 in 1992,
and provided updates and patches to this release through 1995. They also 
wrote the core components of the GRASS 5.0 floating point version. 

In 1997, and after two years of uncertainty, GRASS development was taken 
over by academia: Baylor University in Texas for a period, and then University 
of Hannover in Germany; led by Markus Neteler. The 
[**GRASS Development Team**](http://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Team) 
grew into a multi-national team consisting of developers at numerous locations
who manages the source code, releases, and documentation ever since then.

In October 1999, GRASS GIS in its version 5.0 was released for the first time 
under [GNU General Public License (GPL)](/about/history/gnu-release) and in 
December that year, the source code management moved to the 
first *centralized source code repository*  
(CVS; see https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/changeset/9499). Before that,
mainly manual source code management was done.

### GRASS into the new millenium: 2000 and beyond

Many things have changed dramatically in GRASS GIS development 
since 2000. For example, it moved from CSV to SVN to git for
source code management, from manual bug tracking to GitHub issues,
from the first PHP based website hosted at the University of Hannover, 
to CMS and now hugo, and so much more. Let's go through some
of the most relevant milestones.

Originally, bugs were reported in the mailing list and the bug 
tracking was done manually. But starting in December 2000 and 
until December 2006, the 
[GRASS Request Tracker (RT)](https://web.archive.org/web/20070630161517/http://intevation.de/rt/webrt?q_status=open&amp;q_queue=grass)
was used. This was a huge improvement! 
See how GRASS GIS [bug tracking](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Bug_tracking) 
has evolved through time allowing software to grow better and 
more efficiently.

In February 2006, the [Open Source Geospatial Foundation](http://www.osgeo.org/) 
(OSGeo) was formed to support and promote worldwide use and
collaborative development of Open Source geospatial technologies and data. 
GRASS GIS is one of its founding projects. Later that year, the 
[GRASS Project Steering Commitee](http://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/PSC)
was formed which is responsible for the overall management of the project.

On Dec 9, 2007 GRASS GIS started to use 
[SVN](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GRASS_Migration_to_OSGeo) 
and [Trac](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass) bug tracker hosted by 
OSGeo. Other GRASS GIS project infrastructure like the website and mailing 
lists were (and still are) hosted by OSGeo. Just for fun have a look
at the [GRASS GIS Website evolution](/about/history/web-evolution) page.

In 2013, **we became 30!** Have a look at this nice article from ERDC’s CERL:
[GRASS GIS turns 30 – ERDC’s CERL was there at the start](http://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/Media/News-Stories/Article/476565/grass-gis-turns-30-erdcs-cerl-was-there-at-the-start/)
and the keynote presentation by Markus Neteler at FOSS4G CEE 2013 in Romania:
[Scaling up globally: 30 years of FOSS4G development](https://www.slideshare.net/markusN/scaling-up-globally-30-years-of-foss4g-development-keynote-at-foss4gcee-2013-romania).

Last but not least, in 2019 GRASS GIS migrated the software development 
and bug tracking from OSGeo-SVN to [GitHub](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass).
See the [details](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/GitMigration).
