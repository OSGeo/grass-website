The Project Steering Committee guides the GRASS project’s direction, budget, and
governance, making decisions through voting and overseeing the Core Development
Team which manages source code changes. The project operates under the auspices
of the [Open Source Geospatial Foundation](https://www.osgeo.org/) (OSGeo)
and is fiscally sponsored by [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/).

## Guided by the Project Steering Committee

The Project Steering Committee (PSC) of the GRASS project oversees the
overall direction of the project, budget, and necessary changes to governance or
processes. More specifically, the PSC votes on write access to the source code
repositories, reimbursements, and other issues that are difficult to decide by
developers’ consensus. Major technological or procedural changes are first
proposed and discussed in the form of Request for Comments (RFC) documents and
later voted on by the PSC. The PSC has 9 members and is elected by the
contributor community.

The PSC has a Chair selected from and by the <a href="/about/team">PSC
members</a>. The PSC may create additional roles such as a treasurer and appoint
people to these roles. The PSC appoints and oversees the Core Development Team
and other teams or groups as needed. The PSC makes decisions by voting on RFC
documents, by voting on simple motions, or by consensus among members. The PSC
operations follow [RFC 1: Project Steering Committee
Guidelines](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/blob/main/doc/development/rfc/PSC_guidelines.md)
and [RFC 3: PSC Voting
Procedures](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/blob/main/doc/development/rfc/PSC_voting_procedures.md).

GRASS is under the umbrella of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation
(OSGeo), a not-for-profit organization that aims to foster the global adoption
of open geospatial technology.
As an OSGeo project, GRASS meets established standards for professional governance and development.
OSGeo provides GRASS with technical infrastructure, community coordination,
and a platform for advocacy within the broader open source geospatial ecosystem.
Within the OSGeo organizational structure, the GRASS
PSC is a committee which provides updates about the GRASS project to the
OSGeo Board.

## Fiscally sponsored by NumFOCUS

GRASS is a fiscally sponsored project of NumFOCUS, a
nonprofit dedicated to supporting the open-source scientific computing community.
Through this sponsorship, NumFOCUS provides financial oversight, legal support,
and administrative services, helping ensure the sustainability
and growth of the GRASS project.
NumFOCUS formally recognizes the GRASS PSC as the project's governing body,
with one PSC member serving as the liaison between GRASS and NumFOCUS.
Regular check-in meetings support ongoing communication and collaboration.

## Driven by the Core Development Team

The Core Development Team determines what code additions and changes should be
included in the source code using a change request approval process. The Core
Development Team consists of developers with write access to the project's main
source code repository as approved by the PSC.

Team members are appointed by the PSC and have write access to the main
project’s source code repository. The Core Development Team further decides on
its internal organization for administrative purposes. It may grant individuals
limited access to additional repositories and other resources as needed. The
Core Development Team reports any repository and access rights changes to the
PSC and PSC may request the Core Development Team to report on additional
specific issues.

## Shaped by Reviewed Code Contributions

Source code changes are controlled by the Core Development Team using a change
request approval process. A change request (also known as pull request and merge
request) can be submitted by anyone. The change request is reviewed by the Core
Development Team and a broader consensus is sought out for larger or high impact
change requests. Anyone, including the original change request contributor, may
participate in the discussion about suitability of the proposed code changes or
provide reviews. However, at least one formal approving review by a Core
Development Team member is required for inclusion into the source code. The same
rules apply when a Core Development Team member creates a change request, i.e.,
another member needs to perform the review and approve the change.

Core Development Team members may involve or may defer a decision to the PSC or
its individual members when consensus cannot be reached or when circumstances
seem to require involvement of the PSC members.
