The Project Steering Committee guides the GRASS project’s direction, budget, and
governance, making decisions through voting and overseeing the Developer Team
which manages source code changes. The project operates under the support of the
Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo).

## Guided by a Project Steering Committee

The Project Steering Committee (PSC) of the GRASS GIS project oversees the
overall direction of the project, budget, and necessary changes to governance or
processes. More specifically, the PSC votes on write access to the source code
repositories, reimbursements, and other issues that are difficult to decide by
developers’ consensus. Major technological or procedural changes are first
proposed and discussed in the form of Request for Comments (RFC) documents and
later voted on by the PSC. The PSC has 9 members and is elected by the
contributor community.

The PSC has a Chair selected from and by the <a href="/about/team">PSC
members</a>. The PSC may create additional roles such as a treasurer and appoint
people to these roles. The PSC appoints and oversees the Developer Team and
other teams or groups as needed. The PSC makes decisions by voting on RFC
documents, by voting on simple motions, or by consensus among members. The PSC
operations follow [RFC 1: Project Steering Committee
Guidelines](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/blob/main/doc/development/rfc/PSC_guidelines.md)
and [RFC 3: PSC Voting
Procedures](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/blob/main/doc/development/rfc/PSC_voting_procedures.md).

## Backed by OSGeo Foundation

GRASS GIS is under the umbrella of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation
(OSGeo), a not-for-profit organization that aims to foster the global adoption
of open geospatial technology. OSGeo provides GRASS GIS with legal, fiscal, and
technical infrastructure. In the OSGeo organizational structure, the PSC is a
committee which provides updates about the GRASS GIS project to the OSGeo Board.


## Driven by a Developer Team

The Developer Team determines what code additions and changes should be included
in the source code using a change request approval process. The Developer Team
consists of developers with write access to the project's main source code
repository as approved by the PSC.

Developer Team members are appointed by the PSC and have write access to the
main project’s source code repository. The Developer Team further decides on its
internal organization for administrative purposes. The Developer Team may grant
individuals limited access to additional repositories and other resources as
needed. The Developer Team reports any repository and access rights changes to
the PSC and PSC may request the Developer Team to report on additional specific
issues.

## Shaped by Reviewed Code Contributions

Source code changes are controlled by the Developer Team using a change request
approval process. A change request (also known as pull request and merge
request) can be submitted by anyone. The change request is reviewed by the
Developer Team and a broader consensus is sought out for larger or high impact
change requests. Anyone, including the original change request contributor, may
participate in the discussion about suitability of the proposed code changes or
provide reviews. However, at least one formal approving review by a Developer
Team member is required for inclusion into the source code. The same rules apply
when a Developer Team member creates a change request, i.e., another member
needs to perform the review and approve the change.

Developer Team members may involve or may defer a decision to the PSC or its
individual members where consensus cannot be reached or when circumstances seem
to require involvement of the PSC members.
