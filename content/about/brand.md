    {{< brandLogo colorName="Green"        logo="/images/logos/grass-green.svg"  >}}
        The primary logo of the GRASS project is the green logo. It is used in most cases to represent the project, including official documentation, promotional materials, and the website. This logo should be used whenever possible to maintain brand consistency and recognition.
    {{</ brandLogo >}}
    {{< brandLogo colorName="White"        logo="/images/logos/grass-white.svg" >}}
        The monochrome logo of the GRASS project is the white logo. It is used in contexts where color is not available or where a monochrome design is preferred, such as on printed materials or in black-and-white publications or on a <b class="grass-green">GRASS primary green</b> background.
    {{</ brandLogo >}}
    {{< brandLogo colorName="Blue"         logo="/images/logos/grass-blue.svg"  >}}
        The secondary logo of the GRASS project is the blue logo. It is used in contexts where a different color scheme is needed, such as on darker backgrounds or in materials where the primary green logo does not fit the design aesthetics.

    {{< brandLogo colorName="Gradient"     logo="/images/logos/grass-blue.svg"  >}}
        The gradient logo of the GRASS project is used in contexts where a gradient design is needed, such as on promotional materials or in materials where the primary green logo does not fit the design aesthetics.
