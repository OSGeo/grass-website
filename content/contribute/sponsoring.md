## Sponsoring the GRASS GIS project

### Why sponsor?

*The GRASS GIS project is a volunteer-based organization*, 
it is an affiliated project and founding member of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation ([OSGeo](https://osgeo.org/)).

There is no cost to participate in the project itself or to use the software.

But with our own budget we can produce even better software and documentation for you.
And if you don't have time to contribute, maybe a (small) donation makes you feel better when using GRASS GIS.

Funds offered to GRASS GIS are used to sponsor general GRASS GIS efforts, especially the organization of Community Sprints.
See here to learn more about our [Community Sprints](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Category:Code_Sprint).

### How is the money used?

The donations are controlled in full transparency by the GRASS Project Steering Committee ([PSC](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/PSC)).

We use to organize face-to-face coding sessions (such as the GRASS [Community Sprints](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Category:Code_Sprint)),
 *financial support can be used to make developers' participation possible*.

Also bug fixing may be financed - community polls will identify outstanding problems which cannot be fixed on a voluntary basis;
or specific bug-bounties can be arranged (please [contact us](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/PSC#Members) first).
