## Sponsoring the GRASS project

### Why sponsor?

*The GRASS project is a volunteer-based organization*, 
it is hosted by the
Open Source Geospatial Foundation ([OSGeo](https://osgeo.org/))
and fiscally sponsored by [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/).

There is no cost to participate in the project itself or to use
the software.

But with our own budget we can produce even better software and
documentation for you. And if you don't have time to contribute,
maybe a donation will make you feel better about using GRASS in
your company or research. Your financial support will also help
us to build up the necessary effort and infrastructure to ensure
the long-term sustainability of the project and the software.

### How we use the money

The donations are controlled in full transparency by the GRASS
Project Steering Committee ([PSC](/about/team)).
Funds offered to GRASS will be used to support general GRASS efforts, in particular:

- the organization of face-to-face coding sessions or [**Community Sprints**](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Category:Code_Sprint), *financial support can be used to make developers' participation possible*
- offering [**Student Grants**](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Student_Grants) to support students while they contribute with actual coding, bug fixing, documentation or creation of educational resources.

### How to become a sponsor?

We handle all donations and financial support through
[**NumFOCUS**](https://numfocus.org/donate-to-grass).
You can choose any donation amount—every contribution makes a difference.

If you're an organization interested in long-term support or public recognition,
see the following sponsorship levels and please [contact us](/about/team)

### Sponsorship benefits

All sponsors are important to the GRASS project, no matter
what level of funding they commit to.
In recognition of the different levels of sponsorship,
each sponsor will receive specific benefits. These are mostly
limited to logo sizes, announcements (via mailing list and website 
news items) and social media posts ([X](https://x.com/GRASSGIS) 
and [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@grassgis)) so far, 
but as the PSC sees potential, we will extend the list of benefits 
according to the level of support.
