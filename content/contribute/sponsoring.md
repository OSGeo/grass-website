## Sponsoring the GRASS GIS project

### Why sponsor?

*The GRASS GIS project is a volunteer-based organization*, 
it is an affiliated project and founding member of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation ([OSGeo](https://osgeo.org/)).

There is no cost to participate in the project itself or to use the software.

But with our own budget we can produce even better software and documentation for you.
And if you don't have time to contribute, maybe a (small) donation makes you feel better when using GRASS GIS.

### How we use the money

The donations are controlled in full transparency by the GRASS Project Steering Committee ([PSC](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/PSC)).
Funds offered to GRASS GIS are used to sponsor general GRASS GIS efforts, especially:

- the organization of face-to-face coding sessions or [**Community Sprints**](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Category:Code_Sprint), *financial support can be used to make developers' participation possible*
- offering [**Student Grants**](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Student_Grants) to support students while they contribute with actual coding, bug fixing, documentation or creation of educational resources.

Also *bug fixing may be financed* - community polls will identify outstanding problems which cannot be fixed on a voluntary basis;
or specific bug-bounties can be arranged (please [contact us](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/PSC#Members) first).

### Our Sponsors and supporters
