### Contribute financially
<i class="fa fa-dollar-sign fa-7x" style="float:left;padding-right:15px"></i>
Consider financially supporting GRASS through [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/grass/contribute). The GRASS project is a volunteer-based organization and your financial support is necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of the project and the software. See [sponsoring](/contribute/sponsoring) page for details how to donate and to understand how we use the money to build up the community and software.

### Report a bug or enhancement wish
<i class="fa fa-bug fa-9x" style="float:right;padding-left:10px"></i>
Bug reports and feature requests can be submitted as issues in the [GRASS bugtracking system](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/issues/new/choose). The bug report template will help you fill out relevant information for developers in a concise manner.

### Improve documentation
<i class="fa fa-file-text fa-9x" style="float:left;padding-right:15px"></i>

Writing or editing documentation and tutorials is an ideal platform for your first contribution to the project.

Each GRASS tool comes with a respective [manual page](/learn/manuals) that provides comprehensive documentation including working examples.
There are also various [tutorials](https://grass-tutorials.osgeo.org/) contributed by different developers and users. If you find a piece of information missing or outdated, please contribute!

### Help with translation
<i class="fa fa-language fa-11x" style="float:right;padding-left:10px"></i>
The great worldwide interest in GRASS suggests value in translating GRASS messages to languages other than English. 
The GRASS Development Team is continuously seeking translators.

This is an opportunity to contribute even for non-programmers since messages can be easily translated in a user friendly platform. 
**No programming skills required!**

To contribute, sign in into [**weblate**](https://weblate.osgeo.org/), pick the GRASS project and start
translating. The interface is really simple to use and all the changes you make will be automatically
sent as a pull request to the [GRASS repository](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass).
Please also subscribe to the dedicated [mailing list](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/grass-translations)
and check the [translation glossary](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GRASS_Translation_Glossary) for agreed
terminology in different languages.

### Create an Addon
<i class="fa fa-plug fa-9x" style="float:left;padding-right:15px"></i>
Developing your own tools? Great!

Please upload your addons to the **GRASS Addons repository**. In this way, they become available to the community
through the extension manager (g.extension or graphical user interface). 
Here is the full list of [existing addons](/grass-stable/manuals/addons/) to get inspired.

Further details about how to gain access to our [GitHub Addons repository](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass-addons/) can be
found in [this document](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/HowToContribute#WriteaccesstotheGRASSaddonsrepository).

### Contribute to GRASS core
<i class="fa fa-gear fa-11x" style="float:right;padding-left:10px"></i>
The GRASS core consists of libraries, tools and the Graphic User Interface (GUI).
A good starting point is supporting us with [bug fixing and enhancement wishes](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/issues).
Review these [resources](/contribute/development) to learn how to develop and contribute code effectively.
Feel free to announce your planned development to the [GRASS developers community](https://discourse.osgeo.org/c/grass/developer/61) on Discourse, someone may join you or give you feedback.

For **paid opportunities** to develop code for GRASS, check out our [stipend program](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Student_Grants) for students
and [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) program for students and open source beginners with our [list of ideas](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/GSoC).

### Cite GRASS
<i class="fa fa-book fa-9x" style="float:left;padding-right:15px"></i>

If you use GRASS for developing applications, products or for your scientific
work, please [cite](/about/citation/)
it properly to raise awareness and visibility of the multiple uses of the
software. 

Have a look at our 
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gJ0ZB0cAAAAJ)
profile for examples of GRASS applications in the most diverse fields.
Are you using GRASS in your research and your publication is missing?
[Let us know](https://forms.gle/cDEvMJu7d6nvxLKn9) and we will add it to the Google Scholar profile.
