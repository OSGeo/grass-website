GRASS - **Geographic Resources Analysis Support System** has been under continuous development since 1982 (!).

The strength and success of GRASS relies on the **user community** to improve and extend the GRASS capabilities.
GRASS is developed and supported by a [worldwide team of developers](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/blob/main/contributors.csv).

Many people have contributed to GRASS throughout time. Without them, GRASS would not exist in its current form.
The authors of the individual programs or modules are listed at the end of the respective manual pages.

Read [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file to start to contribute in GRASS development.
