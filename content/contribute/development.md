GRASS - **Geographic Resources Analysis Support System** has been under continuous development since 1982 (!).

The strength and success of GRASS GIS relies on the **user community** to improve and extend the GRASS GIS capabilities.
GRASS GIS is developed and supported by a [worldwide team of developers](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/blob/master/contributors.csv).

Many people have contributed to GRASS GIS throughout time. Without them, GRASS GIS would not exist in its current form.
The authors of the individual programs or modules are listed at the end of the respective manual pages.
