After more than 3 years of development the **new stable release GRASS GIS 8.0**
is available. Efforts were concentrated on making the user experience even better,
providing many new useful additional functionalities to modules and further
improving the graphical user interface. In total, this new release comes with almost
**[1,300 fixes and improvements](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/compare/7.8.6...8.0.0)**
with respect to the previous 7.8 releases. 

**Thanks to all contributors who made this release possible!!!**

## What's new in a nutshell

#### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

GRASS GIS 8.0 graphical user interface comes with an entirely
**new concept of startup mechanism**. Users will no longer 
find any confusing startup screen when launching the software. 
The GRASS GUI data management centerpiece now lies in the enriched
**Data Catalog**, which enables a user-friendly management of
GRASS data hierarchy elements - databases, locations, and mapsets. 
To make the  initial contact easier, all these special terms 
are clarified in the **pre-prepared location** launched when the 
software is run for the first time.
Additionally, some **info bars** appear to help with setting up 
a new location and importing data. 
Thanks to the Data Catalog, the next time GRASS is launched 
**users can switch easily** from the last used mapset to another one.
This makes working with the software easier for both GIS beginners and
existing GRASS users.

#### Raster modules

A new metadata class can now be added to raster maps. We called it *semantic labels*.
Examples of semantic labels are satellite bands (blue, green, red, nir, etc.), dataset
names in remote sensing products (ndvi, evi, lst, etc.), or whatever the user wants to
use to identify raster maps. This new feature brings in a series of advantages.
Users can register time series of satellite images and then select which bands or
semantic labels to work with, for example, estimate NDVI from a Sentinel 2 time series:

`t.rast.mapcalc inputs=test.S2_8,test.S2_4 output=ndvi basename=ndvi expression="float(test.S2_8 - test.S2_4) / (test.S2_8 + test.S2_4)"`

</a>

Semantic labels might be added either by means of the enhanced 
[r.support](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass80/manuals/r.support.html) 
or with a new module
[r.semantic.label](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass80/manuals/r.semantic.label.html) 
that manages (adds, removes or print) semantic label information
assigned to a single raster map or to a list of raster maps. 
Furthermore, semantic labels can also be passed in a text file
when registering raster maps into time series by means of
[t.register](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass80/manuals/t.register.html).

There's a new raster module, 
[r.in.pdal](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass80/manuals/r.in.pdal.html), 
a PDAL based replacement of r.in.lidar 
that allows to import any point dimension (including user defined 
ones e.g. from PDAL filters), supports 19 binning methods (including
eigenvalues) and point filtering by values in any dimension.

#### Imagery modules

All raster classification modules now generate signature files with
embedded semantic labels. This allows to apply the signature file from
one imagery scene (group) to any number of other scenes as long as they
consist of the same bands (as identified by their semantic labels).
This makes it so **much easier to classify different imagery groups 
with identical semantic labels**.

The new module 
[i.band.library](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass80/manuals/i.band.library.html) 
stores and prints available semantic labels used for multispectral 
data. So far only system-defined band references are supported, 
i.e., Landsat 5, Landsat 7, Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2.

#### Temporal GIS modules

With the addition of semantic labels, the temporal database was modified to
version 3 and hence, to be able to read and process GRASS 7.x space-time
datasets, users will be prompted to run the new 
[t.upgrade](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass80/manuals/t.upgrade.html) module.
If users want to read space-time datasets newly created in GRASS 8 back
in GRASS 7.x, they can run
[t.downgrade](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass78/manuals/t.downgrade.html).

#### General modules

[g.extension](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass80/manuals/g.extension.html),
the tool allowing to install extensions, received extensive changes
to adapt to the new [addons repository](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass-addons) 
structure with branches pointing to different GRASS major versions.
This change introduced the possibility to **install pull request branches**
making it so much faster to test new changes.

#### Scripting and code quality

Major efforts have been made to port all Python scripts to Python 3.6.
Also, there's a new Python subpackage for working with locations and mapsets.
All Python code has been formatted with `black` and checked against `flake8`.
Most warnings in C code were removed and are now checked and, all code 
is tested with CodeQL.

#### PROJ and GDAL support

PROJ 4 to PROJ 8 compatibility has been implemented. WKT2 can be 
used for CRS definitions. High-accuracy coordinate transformations supported. 
GDAL 3 compatibility improved with speed-ups.
