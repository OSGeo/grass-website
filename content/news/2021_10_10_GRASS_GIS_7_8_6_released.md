This minor release offers new <a

module that allows to downgrade the version of space time datasets created with GRASS development version. Importantly, this release comes with a critical bugfix: the addon extension
manager has been updated to match new addon repository structure which solves issues found when installing addons in UNIX-like systems. Also
<a
