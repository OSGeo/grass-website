## The new GRASS GIS website is out!

In occasion of its 37th birthday the **GRASS GIS project** is proud to present its [**new website**](https://grass.osgeo.org)! The site has been redesigned with modern tools to be responsive and also easier to maintain. Content is more discoverable now and easy to browse too.

### What's cool

 - The [**Learn**](/learn) page offers a curated list of tutorials in different languages and links to videos. The new [Try online](/learn/tryonline) section provides links to Binder and rollApp online applications that allow testing GRASS GIS without installing it.
 - Our long standing and [**rich history**](/about/history) in the GIS and open source world is now presented in a much more attractive layout. Have a look at the timeline of [*releases*](/about/history/releases) and [*websites*](/about/history/web-evolution) !
 - The revamped [**gallery of screenshots**](/learn/gallery) shows some of GRASS GIS capabilities through visual examples.
 - Project resources easily reachable: mailing lists, wiki, RSS news feed, the various GitHub and docker repositories.

### The technology
We chose a static format based on [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) and all the code and content is hosted in a [dedicated repo](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass-website) in GitHub. [**Nicolas Bozon**](mailto:nicolas.bozon@gmail.com) was the main designer of the website theme and many others helped with content curation and creation. In detail, the page content is now written in markdown. Several times a day the website is automatically deployed from the GitHub repository to our internet server at https://grass.osgeo.org/ .

### What's next
With this new web technology and the availability of the code and content in a public repository, we want to **encourage and simplify community members' participation**. If you want your GRASS GIS use cases, blog posts and cool screenshots to be part of if, you only need to create a pull request. No fear, we have a [manual for contributions](https://grass.osgeo.org/about/theme/).

We thank all the contributors for their input and help to see this project finally realized! 

Stay tuned, there's more yet to come! <i class="fa fa-smile-o fa-2x"></i>
