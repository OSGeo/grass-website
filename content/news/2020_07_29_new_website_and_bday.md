## The new GRASS GIS website is out!

In occasion of the 37th birthday and after many years, GRASS GIS website (https://grass.osgeo.org) got again a new and fresh look. It has been redesigned with modern tools to be responsive and also easier to maintain. The content is also more discoverable now and easy to browse.

### What's cool
Here a short "sightseeing" tour of the new website:
 - The "Learn" page offers a curated list of tutorials in different languages and links to videos. The new "Try online" section provides links to Binder and rollApp online applications that allow testing GRASS GIS without installing it.
 - Our long standing and rich history in the GIS and open source world has now a much attractive layout. Have a look at the timeline of releases and websites, too.
 - The gallery of screenshots has now a revamped display to show some of GRASS GIS capabilities
 - Project resources easily reachable: mailing lists, wiki, RSS news feed, the various GitHub and docker repositories.

### The technology
We chose a static format based on HUGO and all the code and content is hosted in GitHub. Nicolas Bozon was the main designer of the website theme and many others helped with content curation and creation. In detail, the page content is now written in markdown. Several times a day the website is automatically deployed from the GitHub repository to our internet server at https://grass.osgeo.org/ .

### What's next
With this new web technology and the availability of the code and content in a public repository, we want to encourage and simplify community members' participation. If you want your GRASS GIS use cases, blog posts and cool screenshots to be part of if, you only need to create a pull request :-) No fear, we have a manual for contributions (https://grass.osgeo.org/about/theme/).

We thank all the contributors for their input!
