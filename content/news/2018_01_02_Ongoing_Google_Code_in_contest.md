### Ongoing Google Code-in contest

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**High-school students contributing to GRASS GIS through the Google
Code-in contest**

From November 28 last year, high-school students between 13 and 17 years
old are participating in the [Google
Code-in](https://codein.withgoogle.com/) contest. The contest aims at
introducing teenagers to the world of open source and students from all
over the world take part of it. Currently, 17 high-school students are
working on GRASS GIS tasks that go from beginner level such as
\"Installing GRASS GIS and display a map\" to documentation and coding
such as \"Adding examples and screenshots to manual pages\" and
\"Developing tests for different modules\". Moreover, some of them have
contributed videos, designs for the next code sprint t-shirt and splash
screens for wxGUI startup.\
\
Some of the contributions can be seen in the dedicated wiki page:

Meanwhile, there are still two more weeks to go\... so keep tuned and
welcome this great students to our community!
