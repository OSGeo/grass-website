#### **Community Meeting** to celebrate the GRASS GIS 40th birthday!! 

The GRASS GIS Community Meeting was held in the Czech Republic from June
2 to 6 at the Faculty of Civil Engineering of the Czech Technical
University in Prague. The meeting was a milestone event to celebrate the
40th birthday of GRASS GIS and brought together users, supporters,
contributors, power users and developers to celebrate, collaborate and
chart the future of GRASS GIS.

Thanks to the generous funding from OSGeo, FOSSGIS e.V., OSGeo.JP, and
individual financial contributors, we were able to welcome 17 in-person
participants from 9 countries on 3 continents and 4 remote participants.

The meeting was not only a celebration of 40 years of GRASS GIS, a free
geographic information system (GIS) software for managing, analysing and
visualising geospatial data, it was also a testament to the
collaborative spirit that has driven GRASS GIS for four decades.
Participants worked together on various aspects of GRASS GIS, including
source code, documentation, translations and the website. Participants
contributed new tools, enhancements to existing ones, and a large number
of bug fixes. The improvements to documentation, including onboarding
materials, and a draft of the 8.3.0 release was another important
outcome.

There was a strong focus on improving the sustainability of the GRASS
GIS ecosystem. Several participants made progress on the CMake
transition needed for improving Windows builds. Various technical
discussions were held on improving the GRASS GIS interfaces to QGIS,
GDAL, and R. These discussions were attended by special guests from QGIS
(Nyall Dawson) and R (Roger Bivand) communities, leading to valuable
insights and future collaboration plans on strengthening these GRASS
integrations.

Participants submitted detailed reports outlining their contributions,
collaborations and ongoing work. The event was meticulously planned,
with efforts made in fundraising, budgeting, venue selection, promotion
and virtual meeting organisation. Besides aforementioned financial
contributions, personnel time and other costs were covered by Department
of Geomatics Faculty of Civil Engineering Czech Technical University in
Prague (Czech Republic), Center for Geospatial Analytics at North
Carolina State University (USA), mundialis GmbH & Co. KG, (Germany),
CONICET (Argentina), INBO Research Institute for Nature and Forest
(Belgium), SunGIS (Latvia), and OpenPlains Inc. (USA). Special thanks
goes to Martin Landa, the local host, for planning local events and
keeping the participants well fed and productive.
