We are thrilled to announce that the 
**GRASS GIS project got four Google Summer of Code students this year!** 
They will be working together with their mentors in enhancing 
different GRASS tools and capabilities. 

Let's go briefly through some details on each project and their forseen broader impacts. 


#### Parallelization of GRASS GIS existing tools

- Student: **Chung-Yuan Liang**
- Mentors: Huidae Cho, Vaclav Petras

This project is aimed at parallelizing geospatial tools/algorithms to enhance 
GRASS GIS capabilities to utilize and analyze large-scale geospatial and remote 
sensing data. 
While GRASS GIS already has several tools that offer the option to be run in 
parallel, and some other were parallelized during GSoC 2021, in this
opportunity, the targets are:  
*r.texture, r.proj, r.mapcalc, r.horizon, r.viewshed, v.to.rast, r.to.vect*. 
Parallelization should significantly accelerate their processing capabilities 
and bring immediate performance gains in workflows and tools making use of them. 


#### Improve GRASS user experience in Jupyter Notebook 

- Student: **Riya Saxena**
- Mentors: Anna Petrasova, Corey White

The python package [`grass.jupyter`](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass83/manuals/libpython/grass.jupyter.html) 
was developed during GSoC 2021 to simplify running GRASS GIS from Jupyter Notebooks
and displaying data. 
This project will focus on enhancing the user experience by adding features such
as increased interactivity of displayed data to enable query of raster and vector 
attribute, draw a box to set the computational region or draw simple geometries to 
add as GRASS vector maps; use of custom projections with `InteractiveMap` class to
speed up visualization of large maps; and parallelization to speed up rendering of 
`SeriesMap` and `TimeseriesMap` classes.

#### Add JSON output to different tools in C

- Student: **Kriti Birda**
- Mentors: Corey White, Vaclav Petras

Most GRASS GIS tools that output text have custom human readable outputs.
However, they could benefit from storing their output in a portable and commonly
used data format like [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html). 
This project will add JSON as an output format to various existing tools, as well as
Python test cases to verify the output works as intended. 
An option to specify the desired output format (plain or JSON) will 
also be added and the layout of the JSON format will be optimized towards an 
easy ingestion with Pandas in order to streamline the integration into Python 
workflows.


#### Add EODAG support to GRASS GIS

- Student: **Hamed Elgizery**
- Mentors: Luca DeLucchi, Veronica Andreo, Stefan Bluementrath

GRASS GIS has currently various modules to download satellite data: 
*i.sentinel.download, i.landsat.download, i.modis.download*. However, they all 
use different libraries, and some of them are no longer maintained. 
This project will focus on implementing the use of 
[EODAG](https://eodag.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) 
as back-end for those tools and thus, decreasing the maintenance burden 
needed to keep up with all the different APIs updates. 
Furthermore, since EODAG provides a generalized API as an abstraction of 
various data providers, there is the potential to significantly extend the 
currently supported imagery data in GRASS GIS. 

Students, **congratulations on being selected!** ðŸ¤© Mentors, thank you for 
your time and expertise! ðŸ™Œ Everyone, stay tuned and keep an eye on the mailing
list, chat channel and repo! Testing and feedback will be mostly welcome!

Let the journey begin! Happy coding!
