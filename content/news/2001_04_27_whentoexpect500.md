### When to expect GRASS 5.0.0 (stable)?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The current [developer's version](../grasscvs.html) of GRASS 5.0.0 is
quite close to being called "stable". Some more bugs could still be
identified and fixed from the beta11 release published in February
2001.

We are still waiting to publish the stable version because currently
the [GRASS drivers](../gdp/html_grass5/drivers.html) (XDRIVER, HTMLMAP,
PNGdriver, CELLdriver) face a major rewrite and cleanup. We want these
essential drivers to be working properly on most platforms. This cleanup
is considered to be the last change before publishing GRASS GIS
5.0.0.

Sorry to say, we cannot provide a timeline (yet), but the team is
working hard on the remaining problems. There will be a pre-stable
release which needs to be published and widely tested. This pre-release
should be rather identical to the final stable release, only addressing
unknown install problems. Please keep in mind that GRASS operates on
[many platforms](../general.html#platforms) which can be a technical
challenge sometimes.

To find out what's been done since the last publish, read our
[News page](http://freegis.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/~checkout~/grass/NEWS.html)

Working on a reliable open source GIS for you,
