### GRASS GIS 7.0.3RC2 released

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**We are pleased to announce the **second release candidate** of **GRASS
GIS 7.0.3****

**What's new in a nutshell**

The new GRASS GIS 7.0.3RC2 release provides **190 stability fixes and
manual improvements**. compared to version 7.0.2. Of particular interest
is the **new winGRASS 64 bit support**.

*About GRASS GIS 7*: Its graphical user interface supports the user to
make complex GIS operations as simple as possible. The [updated Python
interface to the C
library](/grass70/manuals/libpython/index.html) permits users
to create new GRASS GIS-Python modules in a simple way while yet
obtaining powerful and fast modules. Furthermore, the libraries were
**significantly improved for speed and efficiency**, along with support
for [huge
files](http://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Category:Massive_data_analysis).
A lot of effort has been invested to standardize parameter and flag
names. Finally, GRASS GIS 7 comes with a series of **new modules** to
analyse raster and vector data, along with a full temporal framework.
For a detailed overview, see the list of [new
features](http://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/Grass7/NewFeatures). As a
stable release series, 7.0.x enjoys **long-term support**.

**About GRASS GIS**

The Geographic Resources Analysis Support System
([http://grass.osgeo.org/)](/index.html), commonly referred
to as GRASS GIS, is an Open Source Geographic Information System
providing powerful raster, vector and geospatial processing capabilities
in a single integrated software suite. GRASS GIS includes tools for
spatial modeling, visualization of raster and vector data, management
and analysis of geospatial data, and the processing of satellite and
aerial imagery. It also provides the capability to produce sophisticated
presentation graphics and hardcopy maps. GRASS GIS has been translated
into about twenty languages and supports a huge array of data formats.
It can be used either as a stand-alone application or as backend for
other software packages such as QGIS and R geostatistics. It is
distributed freely under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL). GRASS GIS is a founding member of the Open Source Geospatial
Foundation (OSGeo).
