### New GRASS GIS Web Site

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The new GRASS GIS Web Site is up and running!**

The new GRASS GIS Website
at [https://grass.osgeo.org](/index.html) is finally online,
offering a fresh look-and-feel to users and newcomers!

After several month of development relevant content of the old Website
was migrated to a content management system. The structure was
simplified and put into a more intuitive order.\
\
We hope you enjoy the modernized site. The web team is happy to receive
comments and especially community donated screenshots for the gallery.
Please send to the editors.\
\
Note that the old Website is preserved for a while at
the address [https://grassold.osgeo.org](https://grassold.osgeo.org/) .
Help is welcome to migrate remaining relevant content to the
[Wiki](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/). Furthermore, the mirror sites
will be maintained as software mirror.

Enjoy,

the Web team\
