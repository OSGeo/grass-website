As a follow-up to the previous GRASS GIS 7.8.6 we have published the
**new release GRASS GIS 7.8.7** with more than 40 fixes mostly focused
on [g.extension](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass78/manuals/g.extension.html) 
and Python 3.10 related errors in the GUI. Furthermore,
changes to the *libgis* allowing to recover the last changed date in core
modules and addons' manual pages were backported from newer versions.

The overview of features in the 7.8 release series is available at
