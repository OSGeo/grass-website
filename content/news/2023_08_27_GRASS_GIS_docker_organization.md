### Moving GRASS GIS Docker Images to the OSGeo Repository

In the field of open source software development and deployment, the
accessibility and maintenance of resources is of paramount importance.
To this end, there has been a major change in the repository structure
for the GRASS GIS Docker images.

In the past years, these Docker images have been maintained and hosted under
the mundialis organisation's repository. The company
[mundialis](https://www.mundialis.de) has played a crucial role in providing
and maintaining these images, ensuring their availability and stability for
the wider GIS community. The GRASS GIS development community extends
its sincere appreciation to mundialis for their technical expertise and
consistent support over the years.

In a strategic move, the **GRASS GIS Docker images have now been shifted**
to the OSGeo organisation's repository on Docker Hub. They can be accessed
under OSGeo GRASS GIS on Docker Hub:

[https://hub.docker.com/r/osgeo/grass-gis/](https://hub.docker.com/r/osgeo/grass-gis/tags?page=1&ordering=-name)

This migration is not just a change of repository location. The move to
the OSGeo repository has been accompanied by a systematic clean-up and
reorganisation of the tags associated with the GRASS GIS Docker images.
This restructuring is intended to improve clarity, streamline
versioning and optimise the user experience when selecting appropriate
image tags for deployment.

In summary, as we have phased out the repository under mundialis, we
anticipate improved maintenance and a more streamlined user experience
for GRASS GIS Docker images within the OSGeo framework.
