As a follow-up to the previous GRASS GIS 7.8.4 we have published the
**new release GRASS GIS 7.8.5** with more than 80 improvements. 
This minor release offers new wxGUI fixes across the tree. Also the addon
extension manager received various stability fixes. VRT raster map with tiled
raster maps can now be properly exported and imported in the native GRASS GIS
raster format.

The overview of new features in the 7.8 release series is available at 
[new features in GRASS GIS 7.8](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/Grass7/NewFeatures78).
