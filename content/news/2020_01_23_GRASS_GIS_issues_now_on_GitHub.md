### GRASS GIS issues now on GitHub!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

****GRASS GIS bug reporting and feature request on GitHub now!****

As it was treated in the last [GRASS GIS community sprint](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Talk:GRASS_GIS_Community_Sprint_Prague_2019),
and with the aim of keeping things as simple as possible, we have
finally activated the issue tracker for bug reports and feature requests
in the GRASS GIS [GitHub repo](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/issues).\
\
The old good [trac](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/) site still remains
active for tickets that were originally open there. So, if you have
opened a ticket in trac, please either close it and open a new one in
GitHub referencing the discussion in trac, or just keep it open and
comment there.\
\
For **new issues starting today**, please use
[GitHub](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/issues) :)

We\'ll soon create a template to better follow the different issue types
(bug or enhancement), topics/tags, operating systems, GRASS GIS
versions, etc.
