------------------------------------------------------------------------

**We are pleased to announce the publication of ***Tangible Modeling
with Open Source GIS*****

We are pleased to announce the publication of ***Tangible Modeling with
Open Source GIS*** by Anna Petrasova, Brendan Harmon, Vaclav Petras, and
Helena Mitasova researchers at North Carolina State University OSGeoREL.
This book presents Tangible Landscape, a tangible geospatial modeling
system powered by GRASS GIS. The book provides an overview of tangible
interfaces, describes the design and implementation of Tangible
Landscape, discusses methods of digital fabrication, and demonstrates
applications including landscape management, trail planning, wildfire
management, and coastal adaptation. Besides guides for building and
using Tangible Landscape, the book contains descriptions of geospatial
models implemented in GRASS GIS and their usage.
