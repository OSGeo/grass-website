**The GRASS Development Team announces:**

GRASS GIS 6.0.1 released 22 August 2005
---------------------------------------

A bugfix release of [GRASS GIS](http://grass.itc.it) has been published
today.

The Geographic Resources Analysis Support System, commonly referred to
as GRASS GIS, is a Geographical Information System (GIS) used for data
management, image processing, graphics production, spatial modeling, and
visualization of raster, vector and sites data. It is open source Free
Software released under the [GNU General Public License
(GPL)](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). The new features of GRASS
6 cover a new topological 2D/3D vector engine and support for vector
network analysis. Attributes are now managed in an SQL-based DBMS. A new
display manager has been implemented. The NVIZ visualization tool was
enhanced to display 3D vector data and voxel volumes. Messages are
partially translated (i18N) with support for FreeType fonts, including
multibyte Asian characters. New LOCATIONs can be auto-generated by EPSG
code number. GRASS is integrated with GDAL/OGR libraries to support an
extensive range of raster and vector formats, including OGC-conformal
Simple Features.

### Platforms supported by GRASS:

GNU/Linux, Sun Solaris (SPARC/Intel), Silicon Graphics Irix, Mac OS
X/Darwin, Microsoft Windows with Cygwin, HP-UX, DEC-Alpha, AIX, BSD,
iPAQ/Linux and other UNIX compliant platforms (32/64bit).
