### GRASS GIS 7 Addons Manuals online

------------------------------------------------------------------------

***GRASS GIS 7 Addons Manuals now generated on a weekly basis***

In order to make the manuals more accessible prior to installation, the
[GRASS GIS 7 Addons
Manuals](/grass70/manuals/addons/index.html) are now
generated online every week.

Installation of these **user contributed Addons** can be done easily
with g.extention within a GRASS GIS session (either through the
graphical user interface or via command line). No special administrator
rights are needed.

Current Addons include:

-   Image processing:
    -   Canny edge detector
    -   Histogram matching of several images
    -   Suite to import MODIS satellite data into GRASS GIS
    -   Thermal map analysis to determine Growing Degree Days, Winkler
        index, Biologically Effective Degree Days, Huglin Heliothermal
        index
-   Statistics:
    -   linear regression on time series series
    -   Approximate a periodic time series and creates approximated
        output.
-   Terrain analysis:
    -   Runs r.sun in loop for given time range
    -   Calculate geomorphons (terrain forms) and associated geometry
        using machine vision approach
    -   Hydrological conditioning of DEMs, sink removal to a required
        input elevation map
    -   Creates a local relief model from elevation map
-   Vector analysis:
    -   Create a 3D vector map from a PLY file and export to PLY format
    -   Imports PLY points, georeferences and exports them
    -   Calculation of center points for point clouds, lines and areas
    -   Create concave hull shapes around points
    -   Create transect lines or quadrilateral areas at regular
        intervals perpendicular to a polyline
