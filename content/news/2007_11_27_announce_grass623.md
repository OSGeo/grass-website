**The GRASS Development Team announces**

GRASS GIS 6.2.3 released 27 November 2007
-----------------------------------------

We are happy to announce that a new bugfix version of [GRASS
GIS](http://grass.itc.it) has been released today. This release fixes a
number of bugs discovered in the 6.2.2 source code. It is primarily for
stability purposes and adds minimal new features. Besides bug fixes it
also includes a number of new message translations and updates for the
help pages and projection database.

Highlights include further maturation of the GRASS 6 GUI, vector, and
database code. Some improvements have been backported from the GRASS 6.3
development branch where new development continues at a strong pace of
approximately one code commit every hour, including major work on an all
new cross-platform wxPython GUI and a native MS Windows port.

The *Geographic Resources Analysis Support System*, commonly referred to
as GRASS, is a Geographic Information System (GIS) combining powerful
raster, vector, and geospatial processing engines into a single
integrated software suite. GRASS includes tools for spatial modeling,
visualization of raster and vector data, management and analysis of
geospatial data, and the processing of satellite and aerial imagery. It
also provides the capability to produce sophisticated 4D presentation
graphics and hardcopy maps.

GRASS is currently used around the world in academic and commercial
settings as well as by many governmental agencies and environmental
consulting companies. It runs on a variety of popular hardware platforms
and is Free open-source software released under the terms of the [GNU
General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).

GRASS is a proposed founding project of the new [Open Source Geospatial
Foundation](http://www.osgeo.org/). In support of the movement towards
consolidation in the open source geospatial software world, GRASS is
tightly integrated with the latest GDAL/OGR libraries. This enables
access to an extensive range of raster and vector formats, including
OGC-conformal Simple Features. GRASS also makes use of the highly
regarded PROJ.4 software library with support for most known map
projections and the easy definition of new and rare map projections via
custom parameterization. Strong links are maintained with the
[QuantumGIS](http://www.qgis.org) and [R
Statistics](http://www.r-project.org) projects with integrated GRASS
toolkits available for both.

*We are always looking for testers, code developers, and technical
writers to [help us](http://grass.itc.it/devel/index.php) maintain and
accelerate the development cycle.* The GRASS GIS project is developed
under the terms of the [GNU General Public
License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) (the GPL) [in the
open](http://grass.itc.it/devel/index.php) by
[volunteers](http://grass.itc.it/community/index.php) the [world
over](http://mapserver.gdf-hannover.de/grassusers/map.phtml). GRASS
differs from many other GIS software packages used in the professional
world in that it is developed and distributed by users for users, mostly
on a volunteer basis, in the open, and is given away for free. Emphasis
is placed on interoperability and unlimited access to data as well as on
software flexibility and evolution rate. The source code is freely
available allowing for immediate customization, examination of the
underlying algorithms, addition of new features, and fast bug fixing.

A repository of many community contributed add-on modules is available
on the [GRASS Wiki](http://grass.osgeo.org/wiki/GRASS_AddOns) site.
