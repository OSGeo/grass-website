### Support the GRASS GIS Community Sprint 2011!

 Are you using GRASS GIS for your professional work?\
 Does GRASS help you to perform your spatial data analysis?\
 Want to give back?

 ### The event!

 You are invited to support an upcoming event to make GRASS even
 better. At the \"GRASS Community Sprint 2011\" in Prague, a group of
 developers and users will meet to improve the software, manuals and
 web site. This meeting is open to all interested participants.

 ### How is the money used?

 Based on sponsorship success, we plan to offer in kind support (food
 etc), and, if the budget allows, also partial travel grants may
 become possible. Here we plan to share the remaining funds in order
 to cover a percentage of travel costs for each participant.

 While we are hoping to receive donations especially from
 **companies** which benefit from using GRASS, we certainly welcome
 small donations as well.

 **Please give back** and **donate now** at
