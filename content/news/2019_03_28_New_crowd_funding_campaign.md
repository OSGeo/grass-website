### New crowd funding campaign

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Join our **crowd funding campaign**!**

GRASSGIS friends!\
\
We just launched a **crowd funding campaign** to partially cover the
costs of refreshing and re-styling our website
[grass.osgeo.org](/index.html) to newer standards.

Details about our plans you can find here: [Website migration plan
2019](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Website_migration_plan_2019).

For the realization we need **your support**, all contributions count!\
You can contribute easily via our PayPal Money Pool:\
