### What's new in a nutshell

The GRASS GIS 8.3.1 maintenance release provides more than **60 changes** 
compared to 8.3.0. This new patch release brings in
**important fixes and improvements** in GRASS GIS modules and the
graphical user interface (GUI) which stabilizes the new
**single window layout** active by default.

Some of the most relevant changes include: fixes for `r.watershed` which
got partially broken in the 8.3.0 release; and a fix for installing addons
on MS Windows with `g.extension`.

Translations continue in
[Weblate](https://weblate.osgeo.org/projects/grass-gis/), which
automatically creates pull requests with the translated chunks.
We'd like to **thank the translators of all languages** for their
ongoing support!
