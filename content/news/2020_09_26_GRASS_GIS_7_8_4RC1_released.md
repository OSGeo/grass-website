### GRASS GIS 7.8.4RC1 released

------------------------------------------------------------------------
**What's new in a nutshell**

As a follow-up to the previous GRASS GIS 7.8.3 we have published the
**new pre-release GRASS GIS 7.8.4RC1** with more than 280 improvements.
This minor release again focuses on wxGUI fixes, especially in the animation export, the layer management, 3D visualization and the data catalogue. Many `d.*` modules received fixes as well, and the vector digitizer now works as expected. 

The overview of new features in the 7.8 release series is available at 
[new features in GRASS GIS 7.8](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/Grass7/NewFeatures78).
