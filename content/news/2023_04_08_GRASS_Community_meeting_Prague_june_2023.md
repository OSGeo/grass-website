The [GRASS GIS Community Meeting](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GRASS_Community_Sprint_Prague_2023) 
with users, supporters, contributors, power users and developers 
will take place from **June 2 to 6, 2023**, at the 
[Faculty of Civil Engineering](https://www.fsv.cvut.cz/?lang=en) 
from the [Czech Technical University](https://www.cvut.cz/en) in Prague, Czech Republic.

Community meetings are great opportunities to support the development of GRASS GIS by 
actively contributing to the source code, documentation, translations, website or likewise. 
The community meeting is also a get-together where supporters, contributors, power 
users and developers make decisions and tackle larger problems related to the project, discuss 
and collaboratively resolve bugs, plan the direction of the project and work on new features. 
We welcome people committed to improving the GRASS GIS interfaces to QGIS, GDAL, 
PostGIS, R statistics, OGC services and willing to celebrate with us the 
**40th birthday of GRASS GIS!!**

To support as many attendants as possible, especially students and developers from far away, 
**we welcome sponsorship and financial contributions** via [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/osgeo/projects/grass).
Your contribution counts!
