The [GRASS GIS Community Meeting](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GRASS_Community_Sprint_Prague_2023) 
with users, supporters, contributors, power users and developers 
will take place from June 2 to 6, 2023, at the 
[Faculty of Civil Engineering](https://www.fsv.cvut.cz/?lang=en) 
from the [Czech Technical University](https://www.cvut.cz/en) in Prague, Czech Republic.

Community meetings are great occasions to support GRASS GIS development by actively 
contributing to the source code, documentation, translations, website or likewise. 
The community meeting is also a get-together where supporters, contributors, power 
users and developers make decisions and tackle larger problems related to the project, discuss 
and collaboratively resolve bugs, plan the direction for the project and work on new features. 
We welcome people committed to improving the GRASS GIS interfaces to QGIS, GDAL, 
PostGIS, R statistics, OGC Services and willing to celebrate with us the 
**40th GRASS GIS birthday!!**

To support as many attendants as possible, especially students and developers with far arrival, 
**we welcome sponsors and financial contributions** via [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/osgeo/projects/grass).
Your contribution counts!
