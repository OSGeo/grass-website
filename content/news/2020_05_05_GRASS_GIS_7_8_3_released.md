**GRASS GIS 7.8.3 released**

**What's new in a nutshell**

As a follow-up to the previous GRASS GIS 7.8.2 we have published the
**new release GRASS GIS 7.8.3**. Besides other improvements, this
release offers numerous wxGUI improvements and a number of Mac-specific,
more or less critical bugfixes. A notable improvement is
the now working vector digitizer.

An overview of the new features in the 7.8 release series is available
at [new features in GRASS GIS 7.8](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/Grass7/NewFeatures78).

**About GRASS GIS**

The Geographic Resources Analysis Support System
([https://grass.osgeo.org/](/)), commonly referred
to as GRASS GIS, is an Open Source Geographic Information System
providing powerful raster, vector and geospatial processing capabilities
in a single integrated software suite. GRASS GIS includes tools for
spatial modeling, visualization of raster and vector data, management
and analysis of geospatial data, and the processing of satellite and
aerial imagery. It also provides the capability to produce sophisticated
presentation graphics and hardcopy maps. GRASS GIS has been translated
into about twenty languages and supports a huge array of data formats.
It can be used either as a stand-alone application or as backend for
other software packages such as QGIS and R geostatistics. It is
distributed freely under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL). GRASS GIS is a founding member of the Open Source Geospatial
Foundation (OSGeo).
