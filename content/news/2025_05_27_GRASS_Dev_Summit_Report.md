The **GRASS Developer Summit 2025** brought together **more than 30 contributors**
from around the world for six days of focused collaboration in Raleigh, North
Carolina. Held May 19–24 at North Carolina State University, the event served
as the main annual gathering of the GRASS community, providing space for
developers, researchers, and users to connect, share ideas, and move the project
forward.

## Highlights

The week featured a mix of hands-on hacking, roadmap discussions, and
topic-based working sessions. Participants explored a wide range of

ideas—from improving access to GRASS tools and simplifying color table
workflows, to adding support for *hyperspectral* data, creating a GRASS
*backend for xarray*, and integrating *Jupyter into GRASS GUI*. Other sessions
focused on translation and documentation strategies, the contribution
process for new users, and how to better support scientific and educational
use cases. There was time dedicated to planning GRASS roadmap and discussing
next steps for maintaining and enhancing its core and add-on functionality.
Contributors also worked on parallelization of algorithms, continuous
integration, *conda packaging*, CMake build, compliance with the Filesystem
Hierarchy Standard (FHS), large language models (LLMs), and tutorials for
the [new tutorials website](https://grass-tutorials.osgeo.org/).
Detailed list of contributions can be found at the event's

## Lightning talks

As part of our outreach to the local geospatial community, the
[Center for Geospatial Analytics](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/geospatial/)
helped us to host an evening of lightning talks highlighting the diverse
capabilities of GRASS. Presentations from Markus Metz & Markus Neteler
([mundialis](https://www.mundialis.de/en/)),
Rob Dzur ([Bohannan Huston, Inc.](https://bhinc.com/)),
and Nick Brady ([Natrx](https://natrx.io/)) covered trench planning
for optical cables, elevation-derived hydrography, and coastal erosion
assessments. Six additional speakers from government and academia showcased
GRASS applications in urban growth modeling, species distribution,
continental-scale hydrology, vector data cleaning, lidar-based hydro
flattening, and agricultural runoff modeling with
[Tangible Landscape](https://tangible-landscape.github.io/).

## Thanks everyone!!!

We’re grateful to everyone who helped organize, supported, or participated
in the GRASS Developer Summit 2025. Over 20 people contributed to making it
a success—about half from NC State and half from other institutions. The
summit was made possible through the **generous support** of the U.S. National
Science Foundation (award [2303651](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2303651)),
Bohannan Huston, Inc., and the Center for Geospatial Analytics at NC State,
who provided essential funding, facilities, and technology. We’re also deeply
grateful to the individual contributors who support GRASS through
Open Collective. Consider
[**making a contribution today**](https://opencollective.com/osgeo/projects/grass/contribute/grass-developer-summit-2025-84759)
to help us cover the costs of this event and support the launch of the next one.
