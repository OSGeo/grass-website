### GRASS GIS 6.4.6 released

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**We are pleased to announce the **new stable release** of **GRASS GIS
6.4.6****

Eleven years after the release of GRASS GIS 6.0.0, after 6 years of
developement of the GRASS GIS 6.4.0 and two fruitful community sprints
before and after the FOSS4G 2016 conference in Bonn we are pleased to
announce **the last release of the GRASS GIS 6 line: GRASS GIS version
6.4.6**. This means that there will be no further bugfixing release for
GRASS GIS 6.\
\
We kindly invite all users to upgrade to the bright and shiny [GRASS GIS
7](/grass7/index.html) and benefit from the newest
improvements. It was released over 18 months ago and the fifth bug
fixing release, GRASS GIS 7.0.5, is about to be released. And a new
version 7.2.0 is currently in release candidate state.\

**About GRASS GIS**

The Geographic Resources Analysis Support System
([http://grass.osgeo.org/)](/index.html), commonly referred
to as GRASS GIS, is an Open Source Geographic Information System
providing powerful raster, vector and geospatial processing capabilities
in a single integrated software suite. GRASS GIS includes tools for
spatial modeling, visualization of raster and vector data, management
and analysis of geospatial data, and the processing of satellite and
aerial imagery. It also provides the capability to produce sophisticated
presentation graphics and hardcopy maps. GRASS GIS has been translated
into about twenty languages and supports a huge array of data formats.
It can be used either as a stand-alone application or as backend for
other software packages such as QGIS and R geostatistics. It is
distributed freely under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL). GRASS GIS is a founding member of the Open Source Geospatial
Foundation (OSGeo).
