### Stable GRASS GIS 6.4.4 released

------------------------------------------------------------------------

****Stable version GRASS GIS 6.4.4\
****

**GRASS GIS 6.4.4 released**\
[https://grass.osgeo.org](/index.html)

We are pleased to announce the release of a new stable version of GRASS
GIS. This release fixes issues discovered in the 6.4.3 version of the
program and adds a number of new features. This release includes over
340 updates to the source code since 6.4.3. As a stable release series,
the 6.4 line will enjoy long-term support and incremental enhancements
while preserving backwards-compatibility with the entire GRASS 6 line.

**Key improvements** of the GRASS GIS 6.4.4 release include a complete
rewrite of the r.li suite, major fixes for buffers (v.buffer, now based
on [GEOS library](http://trac.osgeo.org/geos)), major speedup for some
vector modules (v.rast.stats and v.in.gpsbabel), various fixes for the
portable wxPython based graphical interface (wxNVIZ, Location Wizard or
Cartographic Composer), enabled Cairo driver for MS-Windows, and more
user message translations.

Â 



GRASS (Geographic Resources Analysis Support System) is a **free and
open source** Geographic Information System (GIS) software suite used
for geospatial data management and analysis, image processing, graphics
and map production, spatial modeling, and 3D visualization. GRASS GIS is
currently used in academic and commercial settings around the world, as
well as by many governmental agencies and environmental consulting
companies. GRASS GIS can be used either as a **stand-alone application**
or as **backend** for other software packages such as QGIS and R
geostatistics. It is a founding member of the Open Source Geospatial
Foundation ([OSGeo](http://www.osgeo.org/)).
