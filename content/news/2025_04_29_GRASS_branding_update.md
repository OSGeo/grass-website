# GRASS has a new logo—and a simpler name

We’re excited to share some fresh updates to the GRASS project:
a new logo and a small but meaningful change to our name.

## What's new

The updated logo retains the two most recognizable elements of the GRASS visual identity:

- **The grass** — a stylized depiction with multiple narrow leaves and a compact, elongated seed head.  
- **The square** — rotated 45°, forming the background shape behind the grass.

The new version simplifies things while staying true to our roots.
It's easier to use in all the places we need it—on websites, in documentation,
on shirts and stickers, and at any scale. It also aligns with OSGeo branding to help
unify the open geospatial community's visual language.

For full logo usage guidelines and downloadable assets, visit the
[Branding page](https://grass.osgeo.org/about/brand/).

## From GRASS GIS to GRASS

Alongside the new logo, we are simplifying the name we use for the project. Over the years, “GRASS GIS” started showing up in some materials, but most community members have always just called it **GRASS**—especially in conversation. Going forward, we're officially using **GRASS** as the name. That makes things simpler and more consistent.


## Grab some swag

To celebrate, we’ve launched an official [GRASS Swag Shop on Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/grassgis/shop)! You’ll find t-shirts, mugs, stickers, and more featuring the new logo.

Just a heads up: only a small cut of each sale goes back to the project.
