| What do you use Grass for (i.e. what type of work (land use management,satellite images, ...)                  | I encoded the area of work, if possible, but sometimes only type of work was given.                                                                                                                                                                   | to many diverse answers for synthesis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| In what kind of production environment do you use Grass (university,private company, ...) ?                    | If home was given, but for work on academic project, I encoded university; home is only for strict home use.                                                                                                                                          | university : 37  private company : 10  government : 7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| How many people use Grass in your environment ?                                                                | If range was given I encoded maximum of range. If some used it "directly", i.e. direct contact with grass environment, and some indirectly, i.e. access through customized gui or web mapping tool, I encoded total number of users, direct+indirect. | 1 : 27  2 : 12  3-5 : 13  10-70 : 5  > 200 : 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Which version of Grass do you use (i.e. 4.3, 5.0pre2, ...) ?                                                   | When 5.0x plus cvs was given, I encoded cvs.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 4.x : 10  5.x : 46  cvs : 8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| If you are not using 5.x, why not (not stable enough, old version too customized for personal purposes, etc) ? |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | not enough answers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Do you use Grass "as is" or have you adapted it for your usage (i.e. modified/added modules and/or scripts) ?  | If scripts were only shell scripts to automatize some tasks (i.e only binding together existing modules) I encoded as "as is"; if in doubt, I encoded adapted.                                                                                        | as is : 30  adapted : 29                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Have you ever contributed to Grass code (C-code, scripts, others) or documentation ?                           | I encoded actual contributions to central grass development (not local development without contribution to developers list or cvs) or documentation; I did not encoded intended contributions for the near future.                                    | yes : 14  no : 45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 8) What are your wishes for the future of Grass (which new modules, gui, database management, etc) ?           | Functionalities mentioned mean that either that function is desired if it doesn't exist, yet, or an improvement to that function is desired.                                                                                                          | vector : 17  database : 17  gui : 10 (+ others that could probably be interpreted as meaning a gui)  documentation : 8  import/export : 6  easier map viewing : 6  integration with statistical packages : 5  easier (hardcopy) map creation : 5  others mentioned:  fonts  vector overlay functions  don't give up the command line  datum support  etc... |
