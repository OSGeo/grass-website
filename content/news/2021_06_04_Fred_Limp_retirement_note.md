### The GRASS GIS community wants to honor Fred Limp on his retirement
 
The GRASS GIS Project wants to honor **Dr. Fred Limp, Jr.**, on the eve
of his retirement, June 2021, from the Department of Geosciences at 
the University of Arkansas (UA). 

Fred was an early adopter and active promoter of GRASS GIS and 
open source geospatial technologies. He wrote a regular column
called **"Growing GRASS with Fred Limp"** for the GRASS newsletter, 
[**GRASSCLIPPINGS**](https://grass.osgeo.org/files/grassclip6_2_92.pdf)
(see pages 15-16).

Fred founded the 
[Center for Advanced Spatial Technologies](https://cast.uark.edu/) 
at UA in 1991, recognized world-wide for developing and applying
cutting edge technologies for research and education. He also 
taught classes on GRASS GIS for universities and government 
agencies, as well as at CAST.

He was recognized for his contributions to the GRASS Community
with the GAIA Award in 1991. 
Trained as an archaeologist, Fred served as President of the Society
for American Archaeology, and was widely recognized in the field 
for advancing the applications of spatial technology in archaeology
and heritage conservation. This work illustrates the sometimes 
forgotten role of archaeology in the early development and 
applications of GIS and remote sensing. 

The GRASS Community and Project Steering Committee again want to 
recognize Fred Limp for his **lifetime of contribution to open science, 
FOSS, and GRASS GIS**.
