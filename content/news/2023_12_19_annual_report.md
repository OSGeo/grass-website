2023 has been an amazing year in the advancement of GRASS GIS project, which celebrated it's 40th birthday!
To close out the year, let’s review some the accomplishments of the GRASS community.

### Community meeting

The [GRASS GIS Community Meeting](/news/2023_08_13_grass_community_meeting_prague_june_2023_report) held at the Faculty of Civil Engineering of the Czech Technical University in Prague in June brought together users, supporters, contributors, power users and developers to celebrate, collaborate and chart the future of GRASS GIS. Thanks to the generous funding from OSGeo, FOSSGIS e.V., OSGeo.JP, and others, we were able to welcome 17 in-person participants from 9 countries on 3 continents and 4 remote participants!

Moreover, in November, several members of GRASS community were able to participate in-person and remotely in [OSGeo Community Sprint](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/OSGeo_Community_Sprint_2023) in Vienna!


### Development activity
In 2023 there were 4 software releases ([7.8.8](/news/2023_08_06_grass_gis_7_8_8_released/), [8.2.1](/news/2023_01_21_grass_gis_8_2_1_released/), [8.3.0](/news/2023_06_24_grass_gis_8_3_released/), and [8.3.1](/news/2023_10_25_grass_gis_8_3_1_released/)).
GRASS developer community was able to create 418 pull requests (PRs),
merge 387 PRs and solve 103 issues. [9 new addons](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass-addons/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed+is%3Apr+label%3A%22new+addon%22+merged%3A%3E2023-01-01) were added by 7 contributors.

Kudos to GRASS GIS [top 5 code contributors](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/graphs/contributors?from=2023-01-01&to=2023-12-19&type=c) (based on commits): Nicklas Larsson, Tomas Zigo, Markus Neteler, Vaclav Petras and Anna Petrasova. Thanks to the rest 30 core developers and contributors that contributed PRs to the project!
We are also excited to announce we welcomed a new core contributor Edouard Choinière!


### Presentations and Workshops
GRASS GIS was represented on a number of events in a form of a talk or a workshop:

### Grants
A team of researchers from four U.S. universities was [awarded a prestigious grant](/news/2023_09_06_nsf_grant_awarded) from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) to bolster and broaden the community and ecosystem of GRASS GIS. The grant is led by Helena Mitasova, Vaclav Petras, and Anna Petrasova at North Carolina State University with subawards going to Michael Barton (Arizona State University), Huidae Cho (New Mexico State University), and Giuseppe Amatulli (Yale University). See project [1st quarter report and timeline](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/NSF_POSE_Project_2023-2025_Timeline).

A subaward is also going to North Carolina State University from an [NSF grant awarded to Natrx](https://natrx.io/nsf-award-phaseii) to enhance GRASS GIS.

Caitlin Haedrich and Helena Mitasova received a small exploratory grant from NC State University to enhance teaching of an open-educational-resources course on [Geospatial Modeling and Analysis](https://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/geospatial-modeling-course/grass/) currently led by Corey White.

Linda Karlovska was awarded a [GRASS Student Grant](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GRASS_GIS_Student_Grants) to improve a new history browser panel in GRASS GUI.
