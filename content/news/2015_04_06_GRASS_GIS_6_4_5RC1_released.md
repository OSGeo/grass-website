**About GRASS GIS**

The Geographic Resources Analysis Support System
([https://grass.osgeo.org](/index.html)), commonly referred to
as GRASS GIS, is an Open Source Geographic Information System providing
powerful raster, vector and geospatial processing capabilities in a
single integrated software suite. GRASS GIS includes tools for spatial
modeling, visualization of raster and vector data, management and
analysis of geospatial data, and the processing of satellite and aerial
imagery. It also provides the capability to produce sophisticated
presentation graphics and hardcopy maps. GRASS GIS has been translated
into about twenty languages and supports a huge array of data formats.
It can be used either as a stand-alone application or as backend for
other software packages such as QGIS and R geostatistics. It is
distributed freely under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL). GRASS GIS is a founding member of the Open Source Geospatial
Foundation (OSGeo).
