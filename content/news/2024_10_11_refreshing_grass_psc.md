### Welcome to the Newly Elected Members of the GRASS GIS PSC!

In mid-September, the GRASS GIS community began the election process 
to fill the seats previously held by **Helena Mitasova**, **Helmut Kudrnovsky**, 
**Martin Landa**, and **Michael Barton**. After nominations from the community, 
*10 GRASS GIS contributors* stood as candidates for these four PSC positions.

After the election itself, the GRASS GIS PSC welcomed new members, 
namely **Linda Karlovska**, **Nicklas Larsson**, and **Paulo van Breugel**, 
while **Helmut Kudrnovsky** was re-elected for another term. 
The GRASS PSC is now composed of the following nine members:

* Verónica Andreo (continuing member)
* Huidae Cho (continuing member)
* Markus Neteler (continuing member)
* Vaclav Petras (continuing member)
* Anna Petrášová (continuing member)
* Linda Karlovská (new member, 41 votes)  
* Helmut Kudrnovsky (re-elected member, 30 votes)  
* Nicklas Larsson (new member, 30 votes)
* Paulo van Breugel (new member, 29 votes)

For completeness, the election results and the
details about the voting process are available on the
[**PSC Election 2024**](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/PSC_Election_2024) page.

The newly formed PSC held its first meeting on November 8 to discuss
future plans, bringing fresh energy to the project. Here’s to a 
strong PSC and an energized GRASS GIS community, 
helping the project grow and evolve!

On behalf of the GRASS GIS project, we extend our gratitude to 
*Hernán De Angelis* for taking on the role of Chief Returning 
Officer (CRO) and to all community members for their participation. 
We would also like to recognize the great contributions of former 
PSC members, whose dedication has been essential to the project’s success.
We are excited to continue collaborating with them, knowing
their efforts will carry on even outside the PSC.

Let’s wish this new PSC strength and success in building a vibrant 
GRASS GIS community that keeps pushing the project forward!

*The GRASS Development Team, November 2024*
