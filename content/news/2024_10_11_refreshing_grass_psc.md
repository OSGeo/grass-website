### Welcome to the Newly Elected Members of the GRASS GIS PSC!

By mid-September, the GRASS GIS community began the election process 
to replace four of the nine Project Steering Committee (PSC) seats .
These were previously held by **Helena Mitasova**, **Helmut Kudrnovsky**, 
**Martin Landa**, and **Michael Barton**. After nominations from the community, 
*10 GRASS GIS community members* stood as candidates for the positions.

After the election itself, the GRASS GIS PSC welcomed the new members, 
namely **Linda Karlovska**, **Nicklas Larsson**, and **Paulo van Breugel**, 
while **Helmut Kudrnovsky** was re-elected for another term. 
The GRASS PSC is now composed of the following nine members:

For completeness, the election results and the

[**PSC Election 2024**](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/PSC_Election_2024) page.

The newly formed PSC held its first meeting on November 8 to discuss
future plans, bringing fresh energy to the project. Here’s to a 
strong PSC and an energized GRASS GIS community, 
helping the project grow and evolve!

On behalf of the GRASS GIS project, we extend our gratitude to 
**Hernán De Angelis** for taking on the role of Chief Returning 
Officer (CRO) and to all community members for their participation. 
We would also like to recognize the great contributions of former 
PSC members, whose dedication has been essential to the project’s success.
We are excited to continue collaborating with them, knowing
their efforts will carry on even outside the PSC.

Let’s wish this new PSC strength and success in building a vibrant 
GRASS GIS community that keeps pushing the project forward!

*Linda Karlovská and GRASS PSC*
