### Participants of a GRASS GIS workshop contribute new tutorials

The workshop [**Geospatial data analysis with GRASS GIS**](https://ig.conae.unc.edu.ar/taller-grass/)
organized by [Gulich Institute](https://ig.conae.unc.edu.ar/) in Argentina, 
concluded last week with participants from different Latin American countries 
defending their work. The workshop went through different topics within GRASS
ecosystem, but mostly covered remote sensing, Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA)
and time series analysis, making use of GRASS GIS extensions to obtain and 
process Landsat, Sentinel and MODIS data.
All the workshop material including presentations, code, and data, is available
[here](https://gitlab.com/veroandreo/maie-procesamiento/-/tree/taller-grass-online)
(*in Spanish*).

To pass the workshop and get their certificate, students were given two options: 

- write a report in Spanish for which they should pick a topic of 
interest, find relevant data and use GRASS modules to obtain results or, 
- write a tutorial in English of a topic relevant for them or
even something new they wanted to learn.

Topics chosen by the students were diverse and interesting: from changes 
in snow cover in southern Argentina, to productivity of high altitude
grasslands, wildfire simulations, segmentation to aid digitalization
of implanted forests, network analysis, comparison of classification
approaches to map urban areas, landscape characterization, 
urban heat islands, spatial and temporal gap-filling and 
species identification through OBIA and machine learning. Students
overcame installation difficulties, learnt and studied new modules, 
searched for data, explored different solutions. Some, even moved to
Linux and learnt to use Git. It was really satisfying to see their 
learning process and outcome.

Here, I'd like to highlight two outstanding tutorials:

- [â€‹Wildfire Modeling in Yosemite National Park](https://github.com/acoiman/wildfire_modeling) by 
[Abraham Coiman](https://acoiman.github.io/) from Venezuela. 
In this tutorial, Abraham combines the use of GEE, geemap, GeoPandas and GRASS GIS
within a Jupyter notebook to simulate wildfire spread in Yosemite National Park.

- [Segmentation and species classification using hyperspectral data](https://carolgarzon.gitlab.io/webpage/p/post-cinco/) by
[Carol Garzon](https://carolgarzon.gitlab.io/webpage/) from Colombia. In this tutorial, Carol demonstrates
the use of GRASS GIS OBIA toolset for species identification over the *paramo* using UAV hyperspectral data.

**Congratulations all and welcome to the GRASS GIS community!**
