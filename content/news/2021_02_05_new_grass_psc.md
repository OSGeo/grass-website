### New GRASS GIS Project Steering Committee

By the end of last year, the GRASS GIS project called for PSC
members election. A total of *13 GRASS GIS contributors* were 
nominated by the community to cover the nine PSC positions.

After the election itself, the new GRASS GIS PSC is composed 
of the following nine members ranked by number of votes:

* Markus Neteler    (95)
* Anna Petrášová     (88)
* Helena Mitášová    (86)
* Martin Landa          (83)
* Verónica Andreo       (76)
* Moritz Lennert        (74)
* Václav Petráš         (68)
* Michael Barton        (58)
* Huidae Cho            (56)

For completeness, all relevant candidacy communications, 
as well as details about the voting process, have been published at: 
https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/PSC/Election2020
 
On behalf of the GRASS GIS project, we would like to thank
*Hernán De Angelis* who agreed to serve as Chief Returning
Officer (CRO) and all community members for their participation.
Furthermore, we want to acknowledge the contributions of former
PSC members and all nominees. The development of GRASS GIS is a
collective effort and we are all part of it regardless of our
role. So, **CONGRATS to everyone!**

### New PSC chair person 

There's yet one more change to report. GRASS GIS PSC has a new 
chair person: [**Veronica Andreo**](https://veroandreo.gitlab.io/).
She works as a researcher in Argentina focusing on environmental
drivers of vector-borne disease outbreaks and works primarily with
satellite imagery and GIS-based time series analysis. For years, Vero
has been very active in the GRASS GIS project, especially with documenting 
complex topics in a user friendly way, testing, development of the
new website, coding of addons, outreach, social media and more. 
She regularly introduces GRASS GIS to new users and teaches introductory 
and advanced courses and workshops. We thank Vero for accepting this
challenge!

We want to acknowledge and thank [**Markus Neteler**](https://www.mundialis.de/neteler/)
for his enormous efforts and passionate work on pushing the GRASS GIS 
development for more than 20 years. While Markus was re-elected as PSC 
member, he preferred to pass on the position of chairperson to a new 
PSC member. Markus is one of the long runners in the project, as he 
already started to discover the software in 1993 as a student. In 1998, 
he set up a "European GRASS site" at the University of Hannover, which 
evolved into an international development team. From manual source code 
management, he was part of the journey to a modern, GitHub-based 
development system including code quality testing. Markus is known to 
be active in conferences, code sprints, bug fixing, user support, 
infrastructure management, project and release management, etc. He will 
continue to do so!
