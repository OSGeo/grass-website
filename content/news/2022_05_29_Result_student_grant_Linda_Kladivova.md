## Linda's path in her own words
### From enhancing first time user experience to Single-Window in GRASS GIS

I started contributing to GRASS GIS in the summer of 2020 as part 
of the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) project
[*"Creation of a new GRASS GIS startup mechanism"*](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/GSoC/2020/StartupWindow), 
which I applied for as a complete programming illiterate. Although
I felt a bit clumsy at first, with the great help of my mentors, I 
managed to **significantly improve the GRASS data catalog**. 
Looking back now, this was the starting point for all the
upcoming fundamental changes in the graphical user interface (GUI).

In the following months, as part of my master thesis, I focused on 
the topic of a **new startup mechanism** and **the improvement 
of the first-time user experience**. The whole effort led to
eliminating the hard-to-grasp startup screen and implementing
a **new first-time user mode**, which made GRASS significantly more
accessible to new users.

What helped a lot in steering the further implementations were the 
online community surveys I created as part of my master thesis. 
Thanks to them, other thorny topics emerged among which I was mostly 
interested in the need to unify GRASS into a **Single-Window layout**. 
From the very beginning, I wanted to make working with GRASS as pleasant
as possible, but until then I had largely focused on new users. 
I realized that implementing Single-Window would be rather difficult,
requiring significant refactoring of large part of the GUI code.
Therefore, recalling the great experience from GSoC 2020, I eventually
decided to create a mock-up graphic design, which was then the basis for a 
successful application to the next GSoC.

Based on the illustration, my mentors and I managed to rewrite part of the
internal logic of the existing Multi-Window GUI, so that we were able to
start building a new interface next to it. **A very simple Single-Window 
prototype was created within GSoC 2021**, but it was still buggy 
(See details in the project [wiki](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/GSoC/2021/SingleWindowLayout)). 
The fall of 2021 was therefore marked by minor edits that culminated 
in merging a new Single-Window GUI to the main development branch. In
this way, advanced users working with the development version could
try the BETA version of the new GUI.

Soon, of course, there were suggestions for further improvements since the
Single-Window GUI revealed on a larger scale some shortcomings that were 
not so significant in the Multi-Window GUI. Specifically, the crowded 
status bar was perceived as the biggest problem. Fortunately, at that time, 
GRASS announced a [call for student grants](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Student_Grants)
to work on *Mini-projects*. 
I applied, of course, and this was the third project related to GRASS GUI
that I have worked on. The student grant allowed me to dedicate time
to **create a clearer status bar in the map window and a new Map Display 
Settings dialog**.

Although there is still room for improvement, I believe that the new startup
mechanism together with the Single-Window GUI user interface is a **new era for 
GRASS GIS**, as it lowers the entry barrier for GIS beginners and generally enhances
the user experience among GIS professionals.
