### Big bug bashing for GRASS 6!

In order to prepare the upcoming GRASS GIS 6.4.3 release, a major
bugtracker cleanup has been done for GRASS 6 over the past few days.
More than open 300 trac tickets were revisited and updated or closed:
the GRASS GIS bugsquashing team submitted during these days over [140
code changes](http://trac.osgeo.org/grass/timeline), and subsequently 88
tickets could be closed in these few days. The few remaining critical
tickets are being worked on, leading to a new stable GRASS GIS 6.4.3
release to be expected soon.
