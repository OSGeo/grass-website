### Support the upcoming GRASS GIS Community Sprint with a (micro)donation!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**\... don\'t think twice and support the developers with a
(micro)donation!**

Have you been using GRASS GIS within your company or for your daily
tasks? Would like to express your **satisfaction** and **give something
back** to these terrific software developers to make them even happier
during the July's [GRASS GIS Community Sprint in
Prague](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GRASS_Community_Sprint_Prague_2013)?

**In Prague, new features will be developed for GRASS GIS 7, including
wxGUI improvements, temporal GIS algebra, PostGIS Topology support, 3D
interpolation, image processing, and more.**\
\
Hence don\'t think twice and support the developers with a donation!
Please contact Markus Neteler (neteler\@osgeo.org - GRASS GIS PSC Chair)
for further details.\
\
Wait - it is also possible to **buy a round of pizza/beer for the
developers with a quick click** using the PayPal \"Buy
\[pizza/beer/\...\] Now\" button below:

\
**About the Community Sprint**\
\
A \"Community Sprint\" is a get-together for members and supporters of
GRASS GIS and related OSGeo projects to make decisions and tackle larger
problems. Developers and contributors are donating their valuable time,
so appreciate direct or in-kind funding made available for the sprint
meeting to cover out-of-pocket expenses. All of the work that takes
place at the community sprint will be directly contributed back into the
GRASS GIS project to the benefit of everyone who uses it.
