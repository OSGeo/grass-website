Minor updates have been made to the GRASS GIS website contribution
documentation to improve clarity and accessibility for new contributors.

The changes focus on better explaining which steps are optional when
making small documentation or content contributions, such as editing
Markdown files or improving existing text. This helps contributors
understand the contribution process without requiring additional setup
for basic changes.

These updates aim to lower the entry barrier for first-time contributors,
including students and community members who are exploring how to get
involved with the GRASS GIS project through documentation and website
improvements.

No changes were made to existing workflows or contribution requirements;
the update is purely focused on improving clarity and onboarding
experience.
