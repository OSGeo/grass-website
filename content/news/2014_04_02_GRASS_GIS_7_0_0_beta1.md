### GRASS GIS 7.0.0 beta1

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**We are pleased to announce the first beta release of a new version of
GRASS GIS 7.0.**

**What's new in a nutshell**

The graphical user interface based on wxPython has been enriched with
many new features in order to make complex GIS operations available as
simple as possible. The old Tcl/Tk based GUI has been dropped. Relevant
new features are available in the core system, among the most important
the [new Python interface to the C
library](http://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GRASS_and_Python#Python_extensions_in_GRASS_GIS).
This new feature permits Python developers to create new modules in a
simple way while at the same time creating powerful and fast modules.
Furthermore, the vector library was particularly improved to make it
faster and more efficient with support of [huge
files](http://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Category:Massive_data_analysis).
This required a [easy to manage topology format
update](http://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Convert_all_GRASS_6_vector_maps_to_GRASS_7)
including a new spatial index. Finally, there are a series of new
modules to analyse raster and vector data; some of the already existing
modules were improved and made faster (some even 1000 x faster). For
details see below.

**About GRASS GIS**

The Geographic Resources Analysis Support System
([http://grass.osgeo.org/)](/index.html), commonly referred
to as GRASS GIS, is an Open Source Geographic Information System
providing powerful raster, vector and geospatial processing capabilities
in a single integrated software suite. GRASS GIS includes tools for
spatial modeling, visualization of raster and vector data, management
and analysis of geospatial data, and the processing of satellite and
aerial imagery. It also provides the capability to produce sophisticated
presentation graphics and hardcopy maps. GRASS GIS has been translated
into about twenty languages and supports a huge array of data formats.
It can be used either as a stand-alone application or as backend for
other software packages such as QGIS and R geostatistics. It is
distributed freely under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL). GRASS GIS is a founding member of the Open Source Geospatial
Foundation (OSGeo).
