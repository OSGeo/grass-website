The GRASS GIS community is delighted to present the outcome of the
3rd Community Sprint that took place in Genova, from 2nd to 7th of
February, 2013. The event took place at the same time of [XIV Meeting
degli Utenti Italiani Grass e
Gfoss](http://geomorfolab.arch.unige.it/genova2013/index.php?lang=en)
.
The Community Sprint was a creative gathering of both long-term and
new developers, as well as users.

We wish to cordially thank: the Dipartimento di Scienze per
l\'Architettura della Scuola Politecnica of the University of Genova
and [Associazione per le Libertà Informatiche e Digitali
(ALID)](http://www.alid.it) for hosting and technical support. In
particular, we gratefully acknowledged our company sponsors **R3
GIS** (Merano, Italy), **GTER srl** (Genova, Italy), **Intevation
Gmbh** (Osnabrück, Germany), and the individuals *Flavio Rigolon*
(Italy), *Nobusuke Iwasaki* (Japan), and *Giuliano Urgeghe* (Italy).

Developers and users that joined the event came from various
countries like Italy, Czech Republic, Greece, Sri Lanka, and Germany.

The Community Sprint focused on:

- testing/bugfixing of the upcoming GRASS 7 version,
- backporting new functionalities to the GRASS 6 version,
- enhancing existing imagery and remote sensing related processing
modules,
- submission of new sophisticated algorithms for image processing,
time series analysis and processing Earth gravity anomaly,
- developing/refactoring and bugfixing several wxGUI's components,
- further development of the pygrass library,
- translation improvements in Greek and Italian languages,
- improving and maintaining of the GRASS Wiki's structure and
content,
- testing/bugfixing related to related to Mac OS X, MS-Windows and
Linux.

Long-term developers and power users had a chance to discuss about an
integrated and interoperable meta-data mechanism that will ease off
advanced analysis of geospatial data. Another topic was the mentoring
of students for future work on desired remote sensing related
features. Participants of the [XIV Meeting degli Utenti Italiani
Grass e
Gfoss](http://geomorfolab.arch.unige.it/genova2013/index.php?lang=en)
were provided with hands-on support for working with complex
geospatial data.

#### About GRASS GIS

The Geographic Resources Analysis Support System, commonly referred
to as GRASS GIS, is an Open Source Geographic Information System
providing powerful raster, vector and geospatial processing
capabilities in a single integrated software suite. GRASS includes
tools for spatial modeling, visualization of raster and vector data,
management and analysis of geospatial data, and the processing of
satellite and aerial imagery. It also provides the capability to
produce sophisticated presentation graphics and hardcopy maps. GRASS
GIS has been translated into twenty languages and supports a huge
array of data formats. It is distributed freely under the terms of
the GNU General Public License (GPL).
