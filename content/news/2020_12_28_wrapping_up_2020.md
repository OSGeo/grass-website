- source code management: issues moved to [GitHub](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/issues)
- continuous source code analysis with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/actions/)
- three virtual meetings with developers and users to discuss further improvements

We welcome everybody interested in [joining us](https://grass.osgeo.org/contribute/) - consider
to discuss in our mailing lists, suggest improvements, spread the word, translate messages or
