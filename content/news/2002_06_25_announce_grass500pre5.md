for this has started by developers using an experimental series numbered
5.1.x since December 2001.

**[What's new in GRASS 5.0.0pre5:**

- Details: please read [NEWS](../grass5/source/NEWS.html)
- Improvements (excerpt only, for details see NEWS above):
- implemented NAD/NAD datum transformation for r.proj, s.proj, v.proj
 - fixed nasty installation bug
 - implemented "Krovak" and "Krovakgis" projection for Czechia and Slovakia
- updated module documentation ([HTML](../gdp/html_grass5/index.html)
 and [PDF](../grass5/manuals/))

**[GRASS 5 Upgrade NOTE:**
Only, in case you upgrade from GRASS**beta1**..**beta11**, you have to
convert the floating point raster data. [Find more here](announce_lzw_removal.html).

**[Why is 5.0.0 not yet released?**
The developers want to ensure that 5.0.0 is a stable release. With the
current GRASS development team the way GRASS is development has been
changed significantly. It mostly relies on people willing to help. This
5.0.0pre4 release is a candidate for becoming the 5.0.0 release. It can
only be made stable if it enjoys a lot of testing. Please give it a
spin. Report bugs to the [GRASS bugtracker](http://grass.itc.it/bugtracking/bugreport.html)].
Don't hesitate to report a bug which you find in the new release.

In case you are interested to join the developers team, and/or share
algorithms or ideas with the GRASS community, contact us!
