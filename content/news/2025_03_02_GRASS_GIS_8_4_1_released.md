### What's new in a nutshell

The GRASS 8.4.1 release contains more than **80 changes** compared to
version 8.4.0. This new minor release includes **important fixes and
improvements** to the GRASS tools, libraries and the graphical user interface
(GUI), making it more stable and robust for your daily work.

Most importantly, since the
[8.4.0 release](https://grass.osgeo.org/news/2024_07_27_grass_gis_8_4_0_released/):
_location_ is now _project_: The Python API, command line, and graphical
user interface are using _project_ instead of _location_ for the main
component of the data hierarchy while maintaining backward compatibility.

Highlights:

- r.sim.water: the tool and its documentation received various updates
- GUI: many stability fixes
- manual pages: many minor corrections including external URL updates
- Mac binaries are now notarized

Translations continue in
[Weblate](https://weblate.osgeo.org/projects/grass-gis/), which
automatically creates pull requests with the translated chunks.
We'd like to **thank the translators of all languages** for their
ongoing support!
