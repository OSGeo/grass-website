### New GRASS GIS 7.2.x stable release branch created!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Towards the new stable release series**

As of 24 May 2016, a new stable release branch was created for the
**upcoming GRASS GIS 7.2 release**. This new branch includes all the
many improvements which have been implemented in the former development
version 7.1.svn.

What is a branch? In simple words, it is a kind of directory in the
software development server
([SVN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion) in our case) in
which no more development but only bugfixing happens. From a release
branch, new stable releases are created and published.

The actual branches in the GRASS GIS project are:

-   very old stable:
    [releasebranch\_6\_4](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/browser/grass/branches/releasebranch_6_4)
    (used for bugfixing and to publish **stable GRASS GIS 6.4.x**
    releases) - very low release frequency (started in revision
    [r34936](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/changeset/34936))
-   old stable
    [releasebranch\_7\_0](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/browser/grass/branches/releasebranch_7_0)
    (used for bugfixing and to publish **stable GRASS GIS 7.0.x**
    releases) - perhaps one last release upcoming (branch started in
    revision
    [r59487](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/changeset/59487/grass/branches/releasebranch_7_0)
    but development already started in Apr 2008 in
    [r31142](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/changeset/31142))
-   new stable
    [releasebranch\_7\_2](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/browser/grass/branches/releasebranch_7_2)
    (used for bugfixing and to publish **stable GRASS GIS 7.2.x**
    releases) - upcoming series of stable releases (branch started in
    revision
    [r68500](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/changeset/68500/grass/branches/releasebranch_7_2))
-   [trunk](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/browser/grass/trunk) (used for
    **development**, with pseudo-name 7.3.svn) - under heavy development

**Note to SVN users**

The **trunk** branch with pseudo-name 7.1.svn has become **7.3.svn** due
to the creation of the new 7.2.svn release branch. You can simply
continue to update from SVN, the version will be automatically updated.

If you used to work with the 7.0.svn **release branch**, consider to
download the new 7.2.svn release branch, either from the weekly source
code snapshot ([here](/grass72/source/snapshot/index.html))
or from the SVN server directly
([here](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/DownloadSource#GRASS7.2)).

 

**About GRASS GIS**

The Geographic Resources Analysis Support System
([http://grass.osgeo.org/)](/index.html), commonly referred
to as GRASS GIS, is an Open Source Geographic Information System
providing powerful raster, vector and geospatial processing capabilities
in a single integrated software suite. GRASS GIS includes tools for
spatial modeling, visualization of raster and vector data, management
and analysis of geospatial data, and the processing of satellite and
aerial imagery. It also provides the capability to produce sophisticated
presentation graphics and hardcopy maps. GRASS GIS has been translated
into about twenty languages and supports a huge array of data formats.
It can be used either as a stand-alone application or as backend for
other software packages such as QGIS and R geostatistics. It is
distributed freely under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL). GRASS GIS is a founding member of the Open Source Geospatial
Foundation (OSGeo).
