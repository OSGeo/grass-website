GRASS GIS Released Under GNU General Public License!

Geographic Resources Analysis and Support System (GRASS) Geographic
Information System (GIS) has entered a new era with its resurrection by
the GRASS Development Team. The Team, headquartered at Baylor
University, is made up of researchers at Baylor and University of
Hannover, Germany, with cooperators at the University of Illinois. GRASS
is a full-featured GIS that runs on all Unix and Linux operating
systems, thus making it a powerful tool for research groups.

The GRASS GIS, which was originally developed by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, found a new home for support in the GRASS Development Team in
1997. Since that time, GRASS has enjoyed resurgence in popularity around
the globe. However, the problem of licensing was never quite resolved.
Until today.

Since GRASS was initially developed by the U. S. Government, it was
considered Public-Domain. However, the GRASS Development Team is not
government funded and so needed a way to protect the developers and
license the GRASS GIS software.

As of October 25, 1999, GRASS is released under the terms of the Gnu
Public License ([GPL](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html)). The GPL is
part of the [Free Software Foundation](http://www.gnu.org), a non-profit
group that licenses most software developed as "freeware" by
universities and individuals. This makes GRASS the first fully featured
GIS that is released worldwide under the GPL.
