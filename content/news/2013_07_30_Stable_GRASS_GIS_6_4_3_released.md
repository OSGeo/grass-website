### Stable GRASS GIS 6.4.3 released

------------------------------------------------------------------------

****Stable version GRASS GIS 6.4.3 available\
****

**GRASS GIS 6.4.3 released** - Birthday release for **30 years of GRASS
GIS**\
[https://grass.osgeo.org](/index.html)

![30 YEARS OF GRASS
GIS!](../../../27/15/30-years-of-GRASS-GIS-development/index.html)

We are pleased to announce the release of a new stable version of GRASS
GIS. This release fixes bugs discovered in 6.4.2 version of the program
and adds a number of new features. This release includes over\
830 updates to the source code since 6.4.2. As a stable release series,
the 6.4 line will enjoy long-term support and incremental enhancements
while preserving backwards-compatibility with the entire GRASS 6 line.

**Key improvements** of this release include some new functionality
(assistance for topologically unclean vector data), major speedup for
some vector modules, fixes in the vector network modules, fixes for the
wxPython based portable graphical interface (attribute table management,
wxNVIZ, and Cartographic Composer). A number of new modules have been
added for processing LANDSAT and MODIS satellite data, and a new vector
statistics module is also introduced. Many new symbols and north arrows
are available, and the user will find an improved and easier to use
wizard for creating custom project locations with precise map projection
and datum support. Community-contributed add-on modules are now more
easily and robustly installed from an online archive. Other major
developments include enhancements to the Python scripting library and
numerous software-compatibility fixes and translation updates. Important
is the enhanced portability for MS-Windows (native support, fixes in
case of missing system DLLs). And we welcome Romanian as our
twenty-fourth language!

**About GRASS GIS**



 



GRASS (Geographic Resources Analysis Support System) is a **free and
open source** Geographic Information System (GIS) software suite used
for geospatial data management and analysis, image processing, graphics
and map production, spatial modeling, and 3D visualization. GRASS GIS is
currently used in academic and commercial settings around the world, as
well as by many governmental agencies and environmental consulting
companies. GRASS GIS can be used either as a **stand-alone application**
or as **backend** for other software packages such as QGIS and R
geostatistics. It is a founding member of the Open Source Geospatial
Foundation ([OSGeo](http://www.osgeo.org/)).
