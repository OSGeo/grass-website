### New video tutorials now available for GRASS version 8

I am pleased to share a series publicly available YouTube video tutorials for GRASS 8 that I am making this Spring (2022). These tutorials are created for my course ANTH 562 "Computational Archaeology" that I teach at San Diego State University. Although they are created for the curriculum in my course, they should be useful for anyone trying to learn GRASS on their own. My class does not expect any prior GIS knowledge, so even an absolute beginner should be able to follow along. Although I can't make the other course material (syllabus, lectures, readings, discussions) available, I have made the sample data available in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/isaacullah/GIS-Projects) for anyone who wishes to follow along with the video tutorials. 

For convenience, I have created [a YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSCH2IXZ2pHrUXXuOK7EBKWmMD7i6CTA-) where I will add all of the videos as they are created (there are still at least three left to go as of today). The playlist is embedded here:

#### About Me

I am an associate professor of Anthropology at San Diego State University, specializing in computational approaches in archaeology. If the content of the tutorials is interesting and you want to know a little bit more about me, my research, or my teaching, you can head over to [my website](https://isaacullah.github.io/). In particular, the [blog](https://isaacullah.github.io/blog/) and the page about my [Computational Archaeology Lab](https://isaacullah.github.io/CompArchLab/) could be of interest. And of course, please feel free to contact me by email: <iullah@sdsu.edu>.
