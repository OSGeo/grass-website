### GRASS GIS 7.8.4 released

------------------------------------------------------------------------
**What's new in a nutshell**

As a follow-up to the previous GRASS GIS 7.8.3 we have published the 
**new pre-release GRASS GIS 7.8.4** with more than 170 improvements. 
This minor release again focuses on wxGUI fixes, especially in the
animation export, the layer management, 3D visualization and the data
catalogue. Many display modules received fixes as well, and the vector
digitizer now works as expected. 

The overview of new features in the 7.8 release series is available at 
[new features in GRASS GIS 7.8](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/Grass7/NewFeatures78).
