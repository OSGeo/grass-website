A new release of GRASS 5.0.x has been published. This is the stable
release branch of the GRASS project. V5.0.3 is a bugfix release.\

The Geographic Resources Analysis Support System, commonly referred to
as GRASS GIS, is a Geographic Information System (GIS) used for data
management, image processing, graphics production, spatial modeling, and
visualization of many types of data. It is Free Software released unter

GRASS 5.0.3 adds bug fixes, not features. There are no further scheduled
releases in the 5.0.x series, but exceptions might be made for more bug
fixes.

The next planned stable release is 5.4.0. The corresponding development
series 5.3.x has several new modules, and features substantial
improvements in projection capabilities and visualization (\"nviz\").

Major changes to the vector engine and attribute management system have
been implemented in the 5.7.x line, which will become the next major
production series as 5.8.x.

We are always looking for both testers and developers to help us
maintain and accelerate this development cycle.
