**The GRASS Development Team announces:**

GRASS GIS 6.0.0 released 10 March 2005
--------------------------------------

After more than two years of development the first official release of
the next generation implementation of [GRASS](http://grass.itc.it) has
been published (see the [GRASS Development
Roadmap](../devel/roadmap.php)).

The Geographic Resources Analysis Support System, commonly referred to
as GRASS GIS, is a Geographical Information System (GIS) used for data
management, image processing, graphics production, spatial modeling, and
visualization of raster, vector and sites data. It is open source Free
Software released under the [GNU General Public License
(GPL)](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). The new features of GRASS
6.0.0 cover a new topological 2D/3D vector engine and support for vector
network analysis. Attributes are now managed in an SQL-based DBMS. A new
display manager has been implemented. The NVIZ visualization tool was
enhanced to display 3D vector data and voxel volumes. Messages are
partially translated (i18N) with support for FreeType fonts, including
multibyte Asian characters. New LOCATIONs can be auto-generated by EPSG
code number. GRASS is integrated with GDAL/OGR libraries to support an
extensive range of raster and vector formats, including OGC-conformal
Simple Features.

### Platforms supported by GRASS:

GNU/Linux, Sun Solaris (SPARC/Intel), Silicon Graphics Irix, Mac OS
X/Darwin, Microsoft Windows with Cygwin, HP-UX, DEC-Alpha, AIX, BSD,
iPAQ/Linux and other UNIX compliant platforms (32/64bit).

### Software download/CDROM:

- [http://grass.itc.it](http://grass.itc.it/download/index.php)
- [http://grass.ibiblio.org](http://grass.ibiblio.org/download/index.php)
- various [mirror sites](../mirrors.php)
- [GRASS on CDROM/DVD](../download/cdrom.php)

The new source code is available now, and selected binary distributions
for major operating systems will be published shortly.

### What's new in GRASS 6.0.0

**Vector geometry management:** GRASS 6.0.0 comes with a completely
overhauled vector engine which is extended to manage 2D and 3D
topological vector data. The new internal vector data format is portable
between 32bit and 64bit platforms. In addition, a new spatial indexing
system accelerates vector data access and a category indexing system
accelerates attribute queries. Vector data from other GIS software can
be imported (allowing for topological data clean-up) as well as
live-linked into the GRASS database as virtual maps. The new Directed
Graph Library provides support for vector network analysis. Vector map
overlays, intersections and extraction of features are implemented.

**Attribute management:** The new vector engine includes full and
flexible integration of database management systems (DBMS) for attribute
management (currently PostgreSQL, mySQL, DBF, and ODBC are supported).
SQL statements are used to manage attributes. Graphical updating of
vector attributes has been implemented as well.

**User interface:** A graphical user interface (GUI) for every module is
now generated on the fly. A new display manager has been implemented,
which is supplemented by an updated version of the classic
'tcltkgrass' GUI menu structure. NVIZ, the included visualization
package, is enhanced to display 3D vector data. Additionally, a
completely new graphical tool for digitizing has been implemented.

**Internationalization:** The framework to translate GRASS user messages
has been implemented. Currently, the system is [actively
translated](../devel/i18n.php) into several languages including Asian
languages.

**Multibyte FreeType Font Support:** Support has been added to display
FreeType Font in the GRASS display system including [multibyte support
for Asian characters](../devel/i18n.php).

**Multi-session:** Users can now run concurrent GRASS 6.0 sessions. It
is also possible to run GRASS 5.4.x and 6.0.0 in parallel in the same
LOCATION.

**Volume visualization:** NVIZ now supports [volume (voxel)
visualization.](../grid3d/index.html)

**Generating new GRASS LOCATIONs:** New LOCATIONs with automatically set
projection information can be generated by [EPSG code
number](http://www.epsg.org) from the start-up screen. Within a GRASS
session, LOCATIONs can be automatically created from existing datasets
(raster data as well as vector data).

**Interoperability:** GRASS 6.0.0 is integrated with the
[GDAL](http://www.gdal.org)/[OGR](http://www.gdal.org/ogr/) library to
support an extensive range of raster and vector formats.
[OGC](http://www.opengeospatial.org)-conformal Simple Features vector
data are converted into the topological GRASS format; conversely, export
into Simple Features is also possible.

**Enhancements included from 5.4.0:** This release bundles the new
vector capabilities with all the improvements from [GRASS
5.4.0](announce_grass530.html) (e.g. support for datum transformation,
use of external [PROJ4](http://proj.maptools.org) and GDAL/OGR
libraries, shared libraries making binary distributions significantly
smaller, G3D 3-D Raster Voxel tools). The raster capabilities of 6.0.0
are almost identical with those of 5.4.0 except for the addition of
Large File Support (LFS, experimental).

For a more comprehensive list of changed modules see the
[ChangeLog_6.0.0.gz](../grass60/source/).

For a complete list of command in GRASS 6.0.0, see [HTML
manuals](../grass60/manuals/html60_user/index.html).


*We are always looking for both testers and developers to
[help](../devel/index.php) us maintain and accelerate this development
cycle.*
