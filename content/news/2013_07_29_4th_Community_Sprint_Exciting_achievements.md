### 4th Community Sprint: Exciting achievements

------------------------------------------------------------------------

****A brief overview of an outstanding week\...****

The GRASS GIS community is delighted to present the outcome of the **4th
Community Sprint** that took place in a warm and sunny **Prague, Czech
Republic, from July 12 to July 18, 2013**. The event happened after the
[Geoinformatics
conference](http://geoinformatics.fsv.cvut.cz/gwiki/Geoinformatics_FCE_CTU_2013)
at the Czech Technical University in Prague. The Community Sprint was
once more a creative gathering of both long-term and new developers, as
well as users.

This meeting was held in the light of [**30 YEARS OF GRASS
GIS**](http://tinyurl.com/30-years-of-GRASS-GIS)!

\
We wish to cordially thank the **Department of Mapping and
Cartography**, Faculty of Civil Engineering,\
**Czech Technical University** in Prague for hosting and technical
support. In particular, we gratefully acknowledge our **association
sponsors [OSGeo](http://osgeo.org/)  and [FOSSGIS
e.V.](http://www.fossgis.de/)**, and many **individual donors**: *Peter
Löwe, Andrea Borruso, Massimo Di Stefano, Alessandro Sarretta, Joshua
Campbell, Andreas Neumann, Jon Eiriksson, Luca Casagrande, Karyn O
Newcomb, Holger Naumann, Anne Ghisla, Helena Mitasova and Lubos Mitas,
Dimitris Tamp, Mark Seibel, Markus Metz, and Tawny Gapinski*.
These financial contributions were used to cover costs such as meals and
to help reducing travelling and accommodation expenses for participants
with far arrival who came on own expenses.\
\
Developers and users who joined the event **came from various countries
like Italy, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Poland, Sri Lanka/France,
USA** and **Germany**.

The Community Sprint focused on:

-   testing/bugfixing of the [upcoming GRASS 7
    version](http://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/Grass7/NewFeatures),
-   backporting new functionalities to the stable GRASS 6.4 series,
-   testing/bugfixing related to Mac OS X, MS-Windows and Linux,
-   presenting and developing the new [Temporal GIS Algebra in GRASS
    7](http://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/Grass7/TemporalGISAlgebra),
-   connecting GRASS 7 with the [planetary science software
    ISIS](http://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/),
-   discussing integration with [rasdaman.org](http://www.rasdaman.org/)
    software, a powerful multidimensional raster processor,
-   creating 3D vector test data for 3D interpolation,
-   discussing vector conflation,
-   discussing Bundle Block Adjustments,
-   presenting the state of [image processing in GRASS
    7](http://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/Grass7/NewFeatures), and
    discussing its future,
-   improving documentation, with focus on image processing and Temporal
    GIS Algebra,
-   developing/refactoring and bugfixing several wxGUI's components,
-   further developing customizable [wxGUI
    Toolboxes](/grass78/manuals/wxGUI.toolboxes.html)
    concept,
-   improving
    [translation](/development/translations/index.html) in
    Polish and Romanian languages,
-   fixing v.krige in GRASS7 and proposing merge with the recently
    developed v.kriging module,
-   meeting between [Google Summer of Code
    2013](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GRASS_SoC_Ideas_2013#Accepted_Ideas)
    mentor and students.

**About GRASS GIS**\
The Geographic Resources Analysis Support System, commonly referred to
as [GRASS GIS](/index.html), is an Open Source Geographic
Information System providing powerful raster, vector and geospatial
processing capabilities in a single integrated software suite. GRASS GIS
includes tools for spatial modeling, visualization of raster and vector
data, management and analysis of geospatial data, and the processing of
satellite and aerial  imagery. It also provides the capability to
produce sophisticated presentation graphics and hardcopy maps. GRASS GIS
has been translated into about twenty languages and supports a huge
array of data formats. It is [distributed
freely](/download/software/index.html) under the terms of the
GNU General Public License (GPL). GRASS GIS is an official project of
the [Open Source Geospatial Foundation](http://www.osgeo.org/) (OSGeo).
