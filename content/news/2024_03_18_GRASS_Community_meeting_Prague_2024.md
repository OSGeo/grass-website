The [GRASS GIS Community Meeting](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GRASS_Community_Meeting_Prague_2024) 
will take place from **June 14 to 19, 2024**, at the 
[NC State European Center in Prague](https://prague.ncsu.edu/about/), Czech Republic.

Community meetings are great opportunities to support the development of GRASS GIS by 
actively contributing to the source code, documentation, translations, website or likewise. 
The community meeting is also a get-together where supporters, contributors, power 
users and developers make decisions and tackle larger problems related to the project, discuss 
and resolve bugs, draw the project roadmap and work on new features. 
We welcome people committed to improving the GRASS GIS interfaces to QGIS, GDAL, 
PostGIS, R, OGC services and willing to celebrate with us the 
**41st birthday of GRASS GIS!!**

To support as many attendants as possible **we welcome sponsorship and financial support**
 via [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/osgeo/projects/grass/contribute).
Your contribution makes a difference!!
