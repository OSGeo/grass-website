### Call for sponsors

------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Please support the upcoming Vienna Code Sprint 2014\
***

In the occasion of the [upcoming Vienna Code Sprint
2014](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Vienna_Code_Sprint_2014), the GRASS GIS
Project Steering Committee decided earlier this year to officially join
this code sprint, considering it as a great opportunity for joint
activities. **More than 60+ developers from the most important OSGeo
project communities** will be joining the event.

While the GRASS developers are donating their valuable time, the
community of enthusiast users (you!) may [contribute with
donations](/donations/index.html), even symbolic, that will
be used to cover out-of-pocket expenses of the participants. Companies
can also decide to sponsor specific tasks! Please don\'t hesitate
toÂ [contact us](/home/contact-us/index.html) (or Markus
Neteler, neteler\@osgeo.org) for further details.

As usual, all of the work done in the community sprint will be directly
contributed back to the GRASS project for the benefit of everyone who
uses it. Our scope at the sprint is to publish a first release candidate
of the new **stable GRASS GIS 6.4.4 version** as well as a **tech
preview release of GRASS GIS 7**.

For your convenience, here our easy-to-use [Paypal

Thanks for your support!\

**About GRASS GIS**

The Geographic Resources Analysis Support System
([https://grass.osgeo.org/)](/index.html), commonly referred
to as GRASS GIS, is an Open Source Geographic Information System
providing powerful raster, vector and geospatial processing capabilities
in a single integrated software suite. GRASS GIS includes tools for
spatial modeling, visualization of raster and vector data, management
and analysis of geospatial data, and the processing of satellite and
aerial imagery. It also provides the capability to produce sophisticated
presentation graphics and hardcopy maps. GRASS GIS has been translated
into about twenty languages and supports a huge array of data formats.
It can be used either as a stand-alone application or as backend for
other software packages such as QGIS and R geostatistics. It is
distributed freely under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL). GRASS GIS is a founding member of the Open Source Geospatial
Foundation (OSGeo).
