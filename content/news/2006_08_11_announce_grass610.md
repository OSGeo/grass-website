**The GRASS Development Team announces:**


GRASS GIS 6.1.0 released 11 August 2006
---------------------------------------

A new technology preview version of [GRASS GIS](http://grass.itc.it) is
being released today in preparation for the next benchmark release,
GRASS 6.2. This feature release, version 6.1.0, improves upon the
previous stable version of GRASS by adding hundreds of new features as
well as support for the latest GIS data formats.

The *Geographic Resources Analysis Support System*, commonly referred to
as GRASS, is a Geographic Information System (GIS) combining powerful
raster, vector, and geospatial processing engines into a single
integrated software suite. GRASS includes tools for spatial modeling,
visualization of raster and vector data, management and analysis of
geospatial data, and the processing of satellite and aerial imagery. It
also provides the capability to produce sophisticated presentation
graphics and hardcopy maps.

GRASS is currently used around the world in academic and commercial
settings as well as by many governmental agencies and environmental
consulting companies. It runs on a variety of popular hardware platforms
and is Free open source software released under the terms of the [GNU
General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).

Joining GRASS's well-developed raster engine the GRASS 6 series
introduced a new topological 2D/3D vector engine featuring support for
vector network analysis and SQL-based DBMS management of linked
attributes. This release improves the integration and functionality of
the raster and vector engines, and 3D raster (voxel) support has been
greatly enhanced.

A new graphical GIS manager and menu system has been implemented, while
the old GUI display manager has been retained and improved for legacy
support. The NVIZ visualization tool has been enhanced to display 3D
vector data and voxel volumes and supports the creation of on-the-fly
MPEG animations. Additional improvements include substantial message
translation (i18n) with support for FreeType fonts, including multi-byte
Asian characters, and tools to allow new project locations to be
automatically generated from input data or EPSG code.

This is the first release of GRASS as a proposed founding project of the
new [Open Source Geospatial Foundation](http://www.osgeo.org/). In
support of the movement towards consolidation in the open source
geospatial software world, GRASS is tightly integrated with the latest
GDAL/OGR libraries. This enables access to an extensive range of raster
and vector formats, including OGC-conformal Simple Features. GRASS also
makes use of the highly regarded PROJ.4 software library with support
for most known map projections and the easy definition of new and rare
map projections via custom parameterization.

[ChangeLog_6.1.0.gz](../grass61/source/) file.

*We are always looking for both testers and developers to
[help](../devel/index.php) us maintain and accelerate this development
cycle. The GRASS GIS project is developed under the terms of the [GNU
General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) (the GPL)
[in the open](http://grass.itc.it/devel/index.php) by
[volunteers](http://grass.itc.it/community/index.php) the [world
over](http://mapserver.gdf-hannover.de/grassusers/map.phtml). GRASS
differs from many other GIS software packages used in the professional
world in that it is developed and distributed by users for users; mostly
on a volunteer basis, in the open, and is given away for free. Emphasis
is placed on interoperability and unlimited access to data as well as
software flexibility and evolution rate (both added features and bug
minimization).*
