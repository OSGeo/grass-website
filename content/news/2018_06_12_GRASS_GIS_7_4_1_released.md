### GRASS GIS 7.4.1 released

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**We are pleased to announce the **GRASS GIS 7.4.1 **release******

**![GRASS GIS 7.4.1 data

new in a nutshell**

After a bit more than one year of development the **new update release**
**GRASS GIS 7.4.1** is available. It provides **more than 100 stability
fixes and improvements** compared to the previous stable version 7.4.0.
An **overview** of the **new features** in the 7.4 release series is
available at [New Features in GRASS GIS
7.4](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/Grass7/NewFeatures74).

Efforts have concentrated on making the user experience even better,
providing many small, but useful additional functionalities to modules
and further improving the graphical user interface. Users can now
directly download pre-packaged demo data locations in the GUI startup
window. Several modules were migrated from addons to the core GRASS GIS
package and the suite of tools for ortho-rectification was
re-implemented in the new GRASS 7 GUI style. In order to support the
treatment of massive datasets, new compression algorithms were
introduced and NULL (no-data) raster files are now also compressed by
default. For a detailed overview, see the [list of new
features](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/Grass7/NewFeatures74). As a
stable release series, 7.4.x enjoys long-term support.

**About GRASS GIS**

The Geographic Resources Analysis Support System
([https://grass.osgeo.org/](/)), commonly referred
to as GRASS GIS, is an Open Source Geographic Information System
providing powerful raster, vector and geospatial processing capabilities
in a single integrated software suite. GRASS GIS includes tools for
spatial modeling, visualization of raster and vector data, management
and analysis of geospatial data, and the processing of satellite and
aerial imagery. It also provides the capability to produce sophisticated
presentation graphics and hardcopy maps. GRASS GIS has been translated
into about twenty languages and supports a huge array of data formats.
It can be used either as a stand-alone application or as backend for
other software packages such as QGIS and R geostatistics. It is
distributed freely under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL). GRASS GIS is a founding member of the Open Source Geospatial
Foundation (OSGeo).
