### What's new in a nutshell

The GRASS GIS 8.3.2 maintenance release contains more than **30 changes**
compared to 8.3.1. This new patch release includes
**important fixes and improvements** to the GRASS GIS modules and the
graphical user interface (GUI), making it even more stable for daily work.

Some of the most important changes are: fixes for `r.horizon` and 
other modules; improvements in database connections for vector data 
as well as selected manual pages.

Translations continue in
[Weblate](https://weblate.osgeo.org/projects/grass-gis/), which

We'd like to **thank the translators of all languages** for their
ongoing support!
