The GRASS Development Team is pleased to announce that the prebuilt
applications for macOS are now signed and notarized. This enhancement
represents a significant improvement in both security and user convenience.

The currently available notarized binaries include the preview version
8.5.0dev and the release candidate 8.4.1. These versions are bundled with
essential software components, including GDAL 3.10.1, PDAL 2.8.3, PROJ 9.5.1,
and Python 3.12. Future releases will also be signed and notarized to
ensure continued security and compliance.

Download the GRASS GIS App for Mac [here](https://cmbarton.github.io/grass-mac/download/)!

Note: Upon launching the GRASS GIS application for the first time, users will
receive a notification indicating that the application was downloaded from the
Internet. This occurs because the application was not obtained from Apple's
App Store. This message is expected and does not indicate a security issue.
