------------------------------------------------------------------------

**We are pleased to announce the **GRASS GIS 7.6.0 **release******

**What's new in a nutshell**

![GRASS GIS 7.6.0 time series
processing](/images/news/grass760_temporal_plot_labels.png)After
almost 1 year of development the **new stable release GRASS GIS 7.6.0**
is available. Efforts have concentrated on making the user experience
even better, providing many new useful additional functionalities to
modules and further improving the graphical user interface. Furthermore,
ZSTD has been added a new raster compression method which is an
improvement over ZLIB's deflate method, providing both faster and
higher compression than ZLIB. Also a new raster map type has been added:
GRASS virtual raster (VRT) which is a virtual mosaic of the list of
input raster maps. In addition, support for PROJ v. 5 has been
implemented. An **overview** of the **new features** in the 7.6 release
series is available at [new features in GRASS GIS
7.6](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/Grass7/NewFeatures76).

**About GRASS GIS**

The Geographic Resources Analysis Support System
([https://grass.osgeo.org/](/)), commonly referred
to as GRASS GIS, is an Open Source Geographic Information System
providing powerful raster, vector and geospatial processing capabilities
in a single integrated software suite. GRASS GIS includes tools for
spatial modeling, visualization of raster and vector data, management
and analysis of geospatial data, and the processing of satellite and
aerial imagery. It also provides the capability to produce sophisticated
presentation graphics and hardcopy maps. GRASS GIS has been translated
into about twenty languages and supports a huge array of data formats.
It can be used either as a stand-alone application or as backend for
other software packages such as QGIS and R geostatistics. It is
distributed freely under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL). GRASS GIS is a founding member of the Open Source Geospatial
Foundation (OSGeo).
