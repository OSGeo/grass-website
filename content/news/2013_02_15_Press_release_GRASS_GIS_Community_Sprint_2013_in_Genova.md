***Press release***

The GRASS GIS community is delighted to present the outcome of the **3rd
Community Sprint** that took place in Genova, from 2nd to 7th of
February, 2013. The event took place at the same time of the conference
[XIV Meeting degli Utenti Italiani Grass e
Gfoss](http://geomorfolab.arch.unige.it/genova2013/index.php?lang=en).
The Community Sprint was a creative gathering of both long-term and new
developers, as well as users.

We wish to cordially thank: the Dipartimento di Scienze per
l\'Architettura della Scuola Politecnica of the University of Genova and
[Associazione per le Libertà Informatiche e Digitali
(ALID)](http://www.alid.it/) for hosting and technical support. In
particular, we gratefully acknowledged our company sponsors **R3 GIS**
(Merano, Italy), **GTER srl** (Genova, Italy), **Intevation Gmbh**
(Osnabrück, Germany), and the individuals *Flavio Rigolon* (Italy),
*Nobusuke Iwasaki* (Japan), and *Giuliano Urgeghe* (Italy).

Developers and users that joined the event came from various countries
like Italy, Czech Republic, Greece, Sri Lanka, and Germany.

The Community Sprint focused on:

-   testing/bugfixing of the upcoming GRASS 7 version,
-   backporting new functionalities to the GRASS 6 version,
-   enhancing existing imagery and remote sensing related processing
    modules,
-   submission of new sophisticated algorithms for image processing,
    time series analysis and processing Earth gravity anomaly,
-   developing/refactoring and bugfixing several wxGUI's components,
-   further development of the pygrass library,
-   translation improvements in Greek and Italian languages,
-   improving and maintaining of the GRASS Wiki's structure and
    content,
-   testing/bugfixing related to Mac OS X, MS-Windows and Linux.

Long-term developers and power users had a chance to discuss about an
integrated and interoperable meta-data mechanism that will ease off
advanced analysis of geospatial data. Another topic was the mentoring of
students for future work on desired remote sensing related features.
Participants of the [XIV Meeting degli Utenti Italiani Grass e
Gfoss](http://geomorfolab.arch.unige.it/genova2013/index.php?lang=en)
were provided with hands-on support for working with complex geospatial
data.

**About GRASS GIS**\
The Geographic Resources Analysis Support System, commonly referred to
as GRASS GIS, is an Open Source Geographic Information System providing
powerful raster, vector and geospatial processing capabilities in a
single integrated software suite. GRASS includes tools for spatial
modeling, visualization of raster and vector data, management and
analysis of geospatial data, and the processing of satellite and aerial
imagery. It also provides the capability to produce sophisticated
presentation graphics and hardcopy maps. GRASS GIS has been translated
into twenty languages and supports a huge array of data formats. It is
distributed freely under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL).
