**The GRASS Development Team announces:**

GRASS GIS 5.7.0 released 17 June 2004
-------------------------------------

After more than two years of development the first official release of
the next generation implementation of [GRASS](http://grass.itc.it) has
been published. (see the [GRASS Development
Roadmap](../devel/roadmap.php)).

The Geographic Resources Analysis Support System, commonly referred to
as GRASS GIS, is a Geographical Information System (GIS) used for data
management, image processing, graphics production, spatial modeling, and
visualization of raster, vector and sites data. It is open source Free
Software released under the [GNU General Public License
(GPL)](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).

### Platforms supported by GRASS:

GNU/Linux, Sun Solaris (SPARC/Intel), Silicon Graphics Irix, Mac OS
X/Darwin, Microsoft Windows with Cygwin, HP-UX, DEC-Alpha, AIX, BSD,
iPAQ/Linux and other UNIX compliant platforms (32/64bit).

### Software download/CDROM:

- [http://grass.itc.it](http://grass.itc.it/download.html)
- [http://grass.ibiblio.org](http://grass.ibiblio.org/download.html)
- various [mirror sites](../grass.mirrors.html)
- [GRASS on CDROM/DVD](../cdrom.html)

The new source code is available now, and selected binary distributions
for major operating systems will be published shortly.

### What's new in GRASS 5.7.0

**Geometry management:** GRASS 5.7.0 comes with a completely overhauled
vector engine which is extended to manage 2D and 3D topological vector
data. The new internal vector data format is portable between 32bit and
64bit platforms. In addition, a new spatial indexing system accelerates
data access. Vector data from other GIS software can be imported
(allowing for topological data clean-up) as well as live-linked into the
GRASS database. The new Directed Graph Library provides support for
vector network analysis. Vector map overlays, intersections and
extraction of features are implemented.

**Attribute management:** The new vector engine includes full and
flexible integration of database management systems (DBMS) for attribute
management (currently PostgreSQL, mySQL, DBF, and ODBC are supported).
SQL statements are used to manage attributes. Graphical updating of
vector attributes has been implemented as well.

**User interface:** A graphical user interface (GUI) for every module is
now generated on the fly. A new display manager has been implemented,
which is supplemented by an updated version of the classic
'tcltkgrass' GUI menu structure. NVIZ, the included visualization
package, is enhanced to display 3D vector data. Additionally, a
completely new graphical tool for digitizing has been implemented.

**Multi-session:** Users can now run concurrent GRASS 5.7 sessions. It
is also possible to run GRASS 5.3.x and 5.7.0 in parallel in the same
LOCATION.

**Generating new GRASS LOCATIONs:** New LOCATIONs with automatically set
projection information can be generated by [EPSG code
number](http://www.epsg.org) from the start-up screen. Within a GRASS
session, LOCATIONs can be automatically created from existing datasets
(raster data as well as vector data).

**Data Import/Export:** GRASS 5.7.0 is integrated with the
[GDAL](http://www.remotesensing.org/gdal)/[OGR](http://www.remotesensing.org/ogr)
library to support an extensive range of raster and vector formats.
[OGC](http://www.opengis.org)-conformal Simple Features vector data are
converted into the topological GRASS format; conversely, export into
Simple Features is also possible.

**Enhancements included from 5.3.0:** This release bundles the new
vector capabilities with all the improvements from [GRASS
5.3.0](announce_grass530.html) (e.g. support for datum transformation,
use of external [PROJ4](http://www.remotesensing.org/proj) and GDAL/OGR
libraries, shared libraries making binary distributions significantly
smaller, G3D 3-D Raster Voxel tools). The raster capabilities of 5.7.0
are identical with those of 5.3.0.

For a more comprehensive list of changed modules see the
[ChangeLog](../grass57/source/ChangeLog).

For a complete list of command in GRASS 5.7.0, see [HTML
manuals](../grass57/manuals/html57_user/index.html).


*We are always looking for both testers and developers to
[help](../grassdevel.html) us maintain and accelerate this development
cycle.*
