<h3 class="mt-2 mb-4">Plenty of resources</h3>

There are plenty of resources online to get started and learn GRASS GIS: from 
[manual pages](/learn/manuals) for each module and addon with examples, 
[wiki](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GRASS-Wiki) pages with applications 
and use cases to beginner and advanced [courses and workshops](/learn/tutorials), 
videos and presentations for specific topics, 
[jupyter notebooks](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GRASS_GIS_Jupyter_notebooks) 
with different workflows and [books](/learn/books). There is also a 
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gJ0ZB0cAAAAJ)
profile that keeps track of scientific publications and applications
of GRASS GIS in different domains. 
You may even [try GRASS online](/learn/tryonline/) to get a feeling of its capabilities!
