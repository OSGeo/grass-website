<h3 class="mt-2 mb-4">Plenty of resources</h3>

There are plenty of resources to get started and learn GRASS GIS online: from 
[manual pages](/learn/manuals) for each module and addon with examples and 
[wiki](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GRASS-Wiki) pages with applications 
and use cases to beginner and advanced [courses and workshops](/learn/tutorials), 
videos and presentations for specific topics, 
[jupyter notebooks](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GRASS_GIS_Jupyter_notebooks) 
with different workflows and [books](/learn/books). 
You may even [try GRASS online](/learn/tryonle) to get a feeling of its capabilities!
