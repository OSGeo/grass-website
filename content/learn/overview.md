<p><b>G</b>eographic <b>R</b>esources <b>A</b>nalysis <b>S</b>upport <b>S</b>ystem, commonly referred to as <b>GRASS GIS</b>, is a Geographic Information System (GIS) technology built for vector and raster geospatial data management, geoprocessing, spatial modelling and visualization.</p>
<p><b>GRASS GIS</b> is Free, Libre and Open Source Software released under  the terms of the  <a href="../../download/license"> GNU General Public License (GPL v2) </a>. GRASS GIS is also a founding member and an affiliated  project of the  <a href="https://osgeo.org"> Open Source Geospatial Foundation</a></p>

### General presentation

<div class="col-lg-6">
<p>The <b>GRASS GIS</b> project is an international team effort that includes <a href="https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Team">scientists and developers</a> from various fields. GRASS - Geographic Resources Analysis Support System - has been under continuous development since 1982 and it has involved a large number of federal US agencies, universities, and private companies. The core components of GRASS GIS and the management of releases were developed and handled by the Construction Engineering Resesarch Laboratory (CERL) in Champaign, Illinois. Since 1997 a worldwide network of developers continue to release new GRASS GIS versions (see GRASS history section).</p>

<p>The strength and success of GRASS GIS relies on the user community. The philosophy of the GRASS GIS Development Team is to encourage users to develop their own unique tools and applications as well as to improve the existent ones.</p>

<p><b>GRASS GIS</b> runs on Linux, Mac and Windows. It comes with both an intuitive graphical user interface and a command line syntax usefull for automation and production.</p>
<p><b>GRASS GIS</b> contains over <b><a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-devel/manuals/full_index.html" target="_blank">350 modules</a></b> to process and render geographic data. The software allows to manipulate a variety of raster, vector and 3D formats, and run simple to advanced spatial analysis and modeling. GRASS GIS can connect to spatial databases but also interface with a variety of third-party systems and libraries.</p>
<p><b>GRASS GIS</b> capabilities are significantly increased by an impressive list of <b>extensions or add-ons</b>. These modules are contributed by users or developers but are not yet part of the standard distribution.
                    There are currently more than 300 extensions in the <a href="https://github.com/OSGeo/grass-addons/tree/master/grass7" >official GRASS Add-ons repo</a> and many others in the wild to perform the most varied type of tasks.
                    <br>Have a look at the full list of <a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass7/manuals/addons/" target="_blank">add-ons manual pages</a> to get an idea. If you don't find what you need, maybe you can <a href="/contribute/development/">develop</a> your own add-on then.
                    <br>Read <a href="/download/addons/">here</a> to learn how to install them.</p>
