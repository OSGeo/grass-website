### Welcome!

We are happy to count you among our users! You will see that once
you get familiar with GRASS GIS, how it works and what it offers,
you will ask yourself how you could live without it before

Before giving you some tips on how to start, two remarks:

* The GRASS GIS [**community**](/about/community) is a very friendly 
environment and newbies are well treated whatever your questions
or difficulties. So, you should never hesitate to sign up to the 
[**grass-user mailing list**](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/grass-user) 
or use any of the social media channels to reach out and call for help.
* GRASS GIS is extremely powerful and the more you understand some 
of the **basic concepts** behind GRASS GIS, the more you will be 
able to **harness that power**. It is thus worth spending a bit of
time to get familiar with these concepts. **Payback will be manifold!**


### Newcomer tutorials

relevant topic introductions as they will provide you with helpful information 
about how these specific domains are handled in GRASS GIS.
