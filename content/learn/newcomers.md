### Welcome!
We are happy to count you among our users! You will see that once you get familiar with GRASS GIS, how it works and what it offers, you will ask yourself how you could live without it before <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>

Before giving you some tips on how to start, two remarks:

* The GRASS GIS [community](/about/community) is a very friendly environment and newbies are well treated whatever your questions or difficulties. So, you should never hesitate to sign up to the [grass-user mailing list](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/grass-user) or use any of the social media channels to reach out and call for help.
* GRASS GIS is extremely powerful and the more you understand some of the **basic concepts** behind GRASS GIS, the more you will be able to **harness that power**. It is thus worth spending a bit of time to get familiar with these concepts. **Payback will be manifold!**


### Newcomer tutorials
Depending on your favorite medium for learning, different entry doors exist into the marvellous world of GRASS GIS.

#### Written
You can find many tutorials in different languages on the [tutorials](/learn/tutorials) page. But here are some links to specific resources that might help you get started:

* The [Quickstart](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/helptext.html) in the manual pages.
* The [Quick GUI tutorial](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Quick_wxGUI_tutorial)
* An [introductory workshop](http://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/grass-intro-workshop/) from Vaclav Petras & the NCSU GeoForAll Lab.
* The material from the workshop ["From GRASS GIS novice to power user"](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/From_GRASS_GIS_novice_to_power_user_(workshop_at_FOSS4G_Boston_2017))
* For more [specific topics](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/graphical_index.html) (e.g. raster data, vector data, database, etc), you should also read the relevant topic introductions provided as they will provide you with helpful information about how these specific domains are handled in GRASS GIS.

#### Videos
You can just search YouTube for the [GRASS GIS videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=grass+gis) available there. However, here are pointers to some videos that might be particularly useful for you as a beginner:
