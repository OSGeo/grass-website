### Welcome !
We are happy to count you among our users ! You will see that once you get familiar with GRASS GIS, how it works and what if offers, you will ask yourself how you could live without it before :-)

Before giving you some tips on how to start, two remarks


* The GRASS GIS [community](/about/community) is a very friendly environment and newbies are well treated whatever your questions or difficulties. So, you should never hesitate to sign up to the [grass-user mailing list](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/grass-user) or use any of the social media channels to reach out and call for help.
* GRASS GIS is extremely powerful and the more you understand some of the basic concepts behing GRASS GIS, the more you will be able to harness that power. It is thus worth spending a bit of time to get familiar with these concepts. Payback will be manifold !
