### Welcome!

We are happy to count you among our users! You will see that once
you get familiar with GRASS GIS, how it works and what it offers,
you will ask yourself how you could live without it before

Before giving you some tips on how to start, two remarks:

* The GRASS GIS [**community**](/about/community) is a very friendly 
environment and newbies are well treated whatever your questions
or difficulties. So, you should never hesitate to sign up to the 
[**grass-user mailing list**](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/grass-user) 
or use any of the social media channels to reach out and call for help.
* GRASS GIS is extremely powerful and the more you understand some 
of the **basic concepts** behind GRASS GIS, the more you will be 
able to **harness that power**. It is thus worth spending a bit of
time to get familiar with these concepts. **Payback will be manifold!**


### Newcomer tutorials

Depending on your favorite medium for learning, different entry doors
exist into the marvellous world of GRASS GIS.


#### Written

You can find many tutorials in different languages on the 
[tutorials](/learn/tutorials) page. But here are some links to specific
resources that might help you get started:

<img src="/images/gallery/gui/grass75_ndvi_rgb_rio_cuarto.png" width="45%" alt="" style="float:right;padding-left:10px">

* The [Quickstart](/grass-stable/manuals/helptext.html) 
in the manual pages.
* The [Quick GUI tutorial](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Quick_wxGUI_tutorial).
* An [introductory workshop](http://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/grass-intro-workshop/) 
by Vaclav Petras & the NCSU GeoForAll Lab.
* The material from the workshop ["From GRASS GIS novice to power user"](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/From_GRASS_GIS_novice_to_power_user_(workshop_at_FOSS4G_Boston_2017)).
* [Advanced Geospatial Analysis for Earth Observation and Time Series data](https://training.gismentors.eu/grass-gis-irsae-winter-course-2018/) 
a kind of **from zero to hero** GRASS GIS course by Martin Landa, Luca Delucchi
and Stefan Blumentrath.
* For more [specific topics](/grass-stable/manuals/graphical_index.html) 
(e.g. raster data, vector data, time series, database, etc), you should also read the 
relevant topic introductions as they will provide you with helpful information 
about how these specific domains are handled in GRASS GIS.


#### Videos

There are many sources of videos with presentations about GRASS GIS and
tutorials on different topics online.
For example, you can just search YouTube for the [GRASS GIS videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=grass+gis) 
<i class="fa fa-video-camera fa-5x" style="float:left;padding-right:30px"></i>
available there or check different [FOSS4G](https://foss4g.org/) events in the last years 
(have a look at FOSS4G Bucharest 2019 [videos](https://media.ccc.de/c/foss4g2019)). 
Here are, however, some pointers to selected videos that might be 
particularly useful for you as a beginner:

* An [introduction to GRASS GIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wT5SbZtZ12E) 
by Vaclav Petras from the NC State University's Center for Geospatial Analytics. 
Best watched in combination with the [related website](http://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/grass-intro-workshop/)
* [Isaac Ullah's collection](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnXYZpB1oDiK44tV2w9ypvA/search?query=GRASS) 
of tutorials used for his classes, regularly updated to new versions of GRASS.
* [GRASS GIS workshops](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6HFFFYiV4zEYJlQMIXemWA/search?query=grass+gis)
at the [OpenGeoHub Summer School](https://opengeohub.org/) by Veronica Andreo 
and Markus Neteler.
