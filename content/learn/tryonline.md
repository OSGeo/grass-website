<div class="col-lg-6">
<p>The <b><a href="https://jupyter.org/binder">Binder</a></b> project offers reproducible, shareable, interactive computing environments. From the <b>GRASS</b> community, GitHub repositories are available to launch a <b>GRASS</b> computing environment with sample data and working examples.
Through the Binder hub <b>mybinder.org</b>, compute environments defined in the git repositories can be built and started. You can do so by simply clicking on one of the two browser images with Jupyter notebooks:</p>

<p>By clicking on the upper screenshot you can start a basic introduction to Jupyter Notebooks with <b>GRASS</b>.</p>

<div class="col-lg-6">
<p>By clicking on the lower screenshot you can start a full, reproducible geospatial modelling course with <b>GRASS</b>. You can select your topic of interest by double clicking one of the notebooks once Jupyter has started.</p>
<div class="alert rounded-0 alert-default">
<i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> Note: Using <b>GRASS</b> in a Jupyter Notebook requires at least basic skills in Python or UNIX command line and does not include the full graphical user interface (GUI).

### Try GRASS GIS in CoCalc

<div class="container">
<div class="row mt-20">
<div class="col-lg-6 text-center">
<a href="https://cocalc.com/app?anonymous=x11"><img class="bsh" src="../../images/other/GRASS_cocalc.png" width="89%" alt="Try GRASS GIS in CoCalc" title="Try GRASS GIS in CoCalc"></a>
</div>
<div class="col-lg-6">
<p><b><a href="https://cocalc.com/help?session=default">CoCalc</a></b> offers a comprehensive collection of software environments and libraries. It ships hundreds and thousands of Python, R packages or Julia libraries and provides access to over 200 other executables. <b>GRASS GIS</b> is one of them.</p>
<p>In <b>CoCalc</b>, you can try out the graphical user interface (GUI) of <b>GRASS GIS</b> in a full Linux environment in your browser. Click on the image to get to CoCalc. There you can start <b>GRASS GIS</b> by typing "grass" in the console or via the launch button in the lower left tab.</p>
<div class="alert rounded-0 alert-default">
<i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> Note: In the free online version, <b>CoCalc</b> offers only minimal compute resources, so please be patient with load times. Also, there is no download in the free tier, so testing possibilities with real data are limited. Build on Ubuntu stable packages, <b>CoCalc</b> neither offers the latest and freshest versions.

<div class="col-lg-6">
<p><b><a href="https://www.rollapp.com">rollApp</a></b> is a cloud platform for native applications. It allows to run over 300 apps directly in the web browser and can be connected to cloud storages like Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, or Box.
<b>GRASS</b> can be launched as a rollApp. Click on the screenshot to get to the launch site.</p>
<div class="alert rounded-0 alert-default">
<i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> Note: You have to register (which is free) in order to launch a rollApp. <!--And as with CoCalc, only--> Note that only minimal compute resources are available in rollApp.
